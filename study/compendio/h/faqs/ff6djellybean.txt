If you have questions, post there and I will answer it when I can. Sorry
if you can't contact me on AIM anymore...if it weren't for people warning
me up to 70% at times AFTER HELPING THEM, then I wouldn't have to close off
AIM to those who need help with a certain game. Thank you.

   rival and best friend pilot.

   The self proclaimed Treasure Hunter often becomes angry when you call
   him a thief. He is a swift treasure hunter and can pick pockets with
   the best of them. He can never let go of what happened to Rachel, even
   though it was never his fault, he blames himself for what had happened
   because he felt that he was not there when Rachel got killed. That is
   why he has sworn to protect Celes the first time he met her, not letting
   her get in harm's way.

   The main moogle of Narche can speak very fluent english, he is one of
   the fastest(figuratively) talking moogles to come to date, which is
   somehow hidden by his rather "cute pokémon" exterior. He joins the
   party becasue the "old psycho" came in his sleep to be expecting the
   party. He also has a friend in Narche as well that can help them, and
   his best friend is somebody you just don't want to mess with.

 Relm
 ----
   This 10-year old girl rivals that mouth of Mog, but her sensitivity
   towards her grandfather is sometimes misleading. She is more than 
   willing to sacrifice her life for her grandfather, but talks to him
   like an old fool, but in a humorous way of course. She has tremendous
   art skills, even surpassing those who are 2-6 times her age.

 Sabin

   The buff and younger brother of Edgar. He ran away from home while he
   was young because of all the pressure of the succession. His rival
   Vargas however hated him because he was never the successor, and his
   fate ended when he met Sabin for the last time simply because he was
   in too much rush for power.

 Setzer

   The owner of the world's only airship(at the time being) is a lover
   of the Operas, especially the opening. He is a reknown gambler and
   sets his sights on Maria, the Opera Singer with a heavenly voice.
   He is tricked by the party when Celes pretends to be Maria(she looks
   a lot like Maria) to con him into using his airship against Kefka.
   He then sets his sights on Celes, but is conned again, but from what
   he has heard from the party, he is willing to risk his life to take
   down the Empire.

 Shadow

   While on the outside he may seem like somebody who would cut his mother's
   throat for a nickel, he is however an honerable man. Bound with his
   companion Interceptor he travels the world fighting for whoever pays him.
   But in the end he fights for the party for what the Empire tried to do
   to him and also because the party was so willing to accept him, even
   though he was once working for the Empire.

   NOTE: In the SNES version of FFVI(FFIII) whenever the opposition would
         hit Shadow's Dog, the dog would counter attack with a powerful
         attack, but only if the dog blocks the attack. However in the PSX
         version Interceptor just blocks the hit and does nothing. Well
         this actually does happen, except on a less random occasion, at
         least for me on the PSX version anyways.

 ------
 Strago
 ------
   Strago, one of the few remaining Mage Warriors. The Mage Warriors are what
   you can call "Terra." Having magical properties, but they are a lot more
   human than esper. They were left behind by the espers to fend for 
   themselves in the war of the Magi against the Empire. He now lives with
   his granddaughter Relm and his powerful Lore attacks are just what
   the party needs to fight against the Empire.

 Terra
 -----
   The half human and half esper offspring is what resulted from a human
   mother and an esper father. She contains very powerful magical
   properties as she was raised for just a short time by her true parents
   until Emperor Gestahl used her as a biological weapon against the
   espers in hopes of obtaining their power. However since she broke
   free from the Empire, she now turns her fighting skills towards the
   fight for what is right, but somehow she feels there is something
   inside her that is missing.

   This Yeti brute seems unsocially active in presence of people. His best
   friend and companion Mog, who he is willing to take orders from, live
   in the mines of Narche. Mog discovered him when Umaro was younger and
   you can say that Umaro was raised by Mog, but nonetheless their friendship
   is as tight as dried glue, but his intellect seems to be limited.

   Tents and REMEDYs, because most likely your magic will run dry.

-- You might not always have the best equipment on and sometimes the prices 
   can get fairly steep. You should always stay near a save point or a town 
   and wander around and fight enemies for gold, that way you won't be too 
   far off from your resting point incase enemies give you some trouble.

-- Having trouble against a boss? Having the newest equipment is not always 
   the best choice. If you are fighting against Seal(fire) and you so happen 
   to have the FLAME sword then what good will it do you if you just keep 
   healing him? Also some bosses might not have weaknesses and you will have 
   to start gaining some levels before you fight the boss. Also are your rows 
   properly straightened out? Always place fighters up front and magic users 
   or people with low defense in the back, that way you can have more of a 
   balanced approach when fighting against bosses or enemies.

-- If you can heal outside of battle, you should use your magic instead of 
   your items. Items don't come back after use and you will need gold to buy 
   more items. However magic can be replenished at save points, inns, or 
   using your Ethers.

-- When ever you see treasure chests, try to save before you look in them or 
   keep your party's HP up. Sometimes there are monsters inside those 
   treasure chests that will take quite a bit of work to defeat.

-- Keep consideration of your magic points. Using your most powerful magic to 
   defeat opponents is not always the best way to end the battle often you 
   won't have enough to replenish your party's HP.

-- Constantly keep your party's HP up. Unless you are a 100% sure you will be 
   able to mop the floor with your enemies then you should always keep a 
   close eye on your HP.

-- Whenever you bring your party member back from a swoon status always have 
   the next available person heal that party member because your party 
   member's HP will not regenerate themselves and the party member only 
   starts out with 15% of their max HP, so unless you have LIFE2 then I 
   suggest you should always have the next available person heal the party 
   member just back from the swoon status so you wouldn't have to risk that 
   party member suffering a blow that would put that person back on swoon 
   status. 

-- You can switch weapons during battle. Just go to your Item command and 
   scroll up and you will see the weapon or shield in your left and right 
   hands. Hit A on the weapon you want to replace and go over the weapon in 
   your inventory and press A. Be sure to make your decision quick otherwise 
   an opponent can seriously damage your party members while you were looking 
   for the best weapon, so make sure you have the most suited weapon before 
   you enter battle.

-- When your selecting your magic, the Active Time Battle stops so take your 
   time to decide which magic is best.

-- Also continously attack your opponent because unlike previous Final 
   Fantasy games(FF1-3) you will be attacked even if you are not ready, so 
   make sure you attack quickly. Incase you still need some time to think you 
   can always hit the Start button during battle to pause the game.

-- Keep magic users in the magic and fighters in the front, that way your 
   healers won't die so quickly. You can also do this during battle by 
   hitting the control pad left on the command box, but its only for the 
   battle. To make this permanent(or until you decide to change it again) go 
   to your menu screen and hit change. Also you can switch the position of 
   your characters by using the Form command on the Menu Screen.

-- Always check pots or other things that can carry items besides treasure 
   chests, although most of the things you find are just Potions, you should 
   pick them up anyways because hey, they're free!

-- Not Bosses in this game do not provide expierience points. So don't expect
   to earn expierience points by defeating bosses or expect to gain that
   extra level because it won't happen.

-- If this is your first time playing an RPG game or Final Fantasy game for 
   that matter then I suggest you go to the Training Room in the Town of 
   Tule to gather up information about the basics of the game. Learning the 
   basics of the game will help you learn some of the more advance and 
   complex features of the games and also most other RPGs.

-- Try to keep all weapons you find that normally are not sold at weapons 
   shops, also armors, they can help you out in future battles or when your 
   Bow and Arrow users run out of Bows and they need a new weapon to use in 
   the middle of battles.

-- Riding Chocobos is a fun way to move across town to town, but if your 
   riding Chocobos enemies can't attack you, so your better off that way 
   right? Wrong. Riding Chocobos mean that you do not gain any expierience 
   points or GOLD from the enemies you would have fought. So when your losing 
   battles or when you do not have enough money for equipment then you will 
   realize that riding chocobos is not a good idea, but however if you are 
   low on life and your magic is out and your cure supplies are gone not to 
   mention TENTs and REMEDYs then it would be a good idea to make it to the 
   next town without fighting any random encounters.

-- If you haven't noticed it, your levels are divided among your party 
   members. Sometimes it might take a long while to gain levels, but there is 
   an easy way to gain expierience quickly. Say you have five party members 
   in your group and Locke needs to reach level 99. First off you swoon the 
   other three party members besides Locke. Hopefully Locke is strong enough 
   to fight on his own, then have Locke fight any random encounters, its best 
   if he fights opponents like the TUMBLEWEED or BRACHEOSAUR. Here just have 
   Locke win, at first it might seem like a struggle, but Locke will gain 
   levels 4 times faster than before because his party members' expierience 
   points are given to Locke because his other party members did not 
   participate in battle.

-- If you have two parties in low HP and your in a cave near a save point,
   then this is a neat trick for you to do. Have both parties stand on the 
   same save point and use a TENT. Afterwards both your parties will be fully
   healed!

-- When you lose battles, and yes you will lose battles, make sure you go to
   your esper system menu and switch espers. Your summons can be used only
   once during the battle and it works the same way as switching weapons
   in your hand, just go to magic and hit the cursor up and your esper should
   appear.

-- Spears do twice as much damage than a regular attack when you attack with
   the JUMP command. Make sure you always jump, but be warned that it takes 
   about 2 turns to use the JUMP command and when you need to finish off an 
   opponent quick its not always the best thing to use.

-- Dash can only be used if you have gained a certain amount of levels for 
   Thief, once you have it you can make your trip faster and random battles
   occur less often.

-- In the World of Ruin, you can bring back your swoon party member back to
   life without magic or inns or the use of items. Go to the Collesseum
   and have a swoon character fight, and if they win they will be back at
   full HP and MP!

-- NOTE: The following tip is provided by Reyno Gaspar, a very useful one
         might I add.

   "Welp, anyway, if all your people have wall/reflect/anything that
   reflects magic, cast an offensive spell on all four/five people.  The
   spell will reflect off them and hit the enemy.  But, there's something
   cool about it.  Ya know how spell damage is divided when you cast a
   spell on multiple characters?  Well, if your fighting an annoying boss
   or some lone enemy and cast a spell on all of your walled up characters,
   the divisions will actually ADD up and hurt more that it would usually
   hurt if you hit the enemy directly with the spell.  If you're fighting
   an enemy with 4 people walled up and cast an offensive spell on all four
   walled up characters, the enemy will be hit with the spell FOUR times!
   Ouch!  Also, if the foolish enemy casts an offensive spell, he'll hit
   himself!  Hah!

   But, there are some disadvantages with it.  One obvious one is that you
   can't use any white spells on yourself.  Two, when fighting a group,
   this spells will bounce and hit any one of them, not directing the one
   spell on one guy.

   But, this can be useful.  I remember I killed a GrandMummy (FFV 8000)
   and a Gargoyle (FFV 5000) with just one Fire 3 on my characters and with
   one Fire 3, I won!  Hah!"

-- Finally, last but not least talk to everybody in town, you never know what 
   you might expect. Talk to them twice if you have to, maybe something
   might slip from them.

=============================================================================
=============================================================================


  Now insert either your Final Fantasy VI CD or Super NES Final Fantasy III
  cartridge it doesn't matter and watch the sweet new intro for the game.
  It was long ago when the world was reduced to nothing after the War of
  the Magi and magic simply ceased to exist. 1000 years have passed and 
  Iron, Gunpower, Steam Engines, every new technology was discovered. But
  there are still those people out there that would try to revive magic
  and make the world their kingdom, would the same deadly and senseless
  mistake be repeated? 


=============================================================================
THE MYSTERY OF THE ESPERS
Items: Elixir, Tonic, Sleeping Bag(2), Tincture, Phoenix Down
Party: Terra, (Vicks), (Wedge)
Party's level: 1
=============================================================================

Here you will see the scenes with Biggs(Vicks in FF3 for U.S.) and Wedge
talking over about the esper and about the mysterious woman who appears to be 
a sorcerer. They then leave off to the town below. Here is where the original 
intro took place(the music is a bit off but as memorable as ever) as the 
graphics still impress me believe it or not, oh yeah the credits roll as 
well. Afterwards Wedge decides to put the mysterious woman at point, since 
its no sense for them to take any risks. Now that you are in control head for 
the mines up north of town, but along the way there will be a couple of 
battles to deal with but the battles are pretty easy. Inside the mines is a 
save point for you to save your game, no sense in healing your wounds since 
you have no TENTs to begin with! Continue to go north, and Biggs will ram the 
gates open, but another rather weak battle is ensued. But this time its a 
boss.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS BATTLE: Whelk     HP: 1600     ITEM: Potion
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aw schnap! The boss music! Its just so tite! In this battle Biggs and Wedge 
talk about a monster that eats lightning and stores it in its shell, so 
whatever you do DON'T ATTACK THE SHELL! Aim for the head in this battle and 
have Terra use her Tekmissle attack and heal if neccessary in this battle 
with the Heal Force obviously. After a while it will hide in its shell, at 
this time do not attack it or you will recieve a very painful counter attack 
called Mega Volt that will deal about 60 HP of damage to any magitek member, 
which is enough to wipe any of you out.

After the battle continue on to the next room and you will find a frozen 
esper in the middle. Then suddenly it de-frosts itself and attacks the party.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS BATTLE: Tritoch     HP: N/A
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This isn't really a boss fight. It just has that boss fight environment so I 
thought I could make it look like it was a boss fight. In here the mysterious 
girl goes over to the half defrost esper as Biggs and Wedge wonders where the 
light is coming from. Then they both disappear and the esper self ignites and 
takes the mysterious girl with it.

=============================================================================
THE START OF THE ADVENTURE ARISES
Items: *Look Above*
Party: Locke
Party's level: 2
=============================================================================

You will awake in the town of Narche, the coal mines up north are a part of 
this town and luckily a man found you and recovered you. Talk to him and he 
will tell you that he had just removed the Slave Crown, which had been 
controlling the mysterious girl all this time. She still does not remember a 
thing though:

  "A mysterious young woman, controlled by the Empire, and born with the
   gift of Magic......"
  
Here you will be asked to input a name, its better to select the default
because no one will like such geeky names like Jeff, Brian, M.Bison, or 
CJayc(just kidding!). As long as you input Terra or Dingo you should be fine. 
Afterwards she remembers her name, which is whatever you inputed but its 
Terra. The old man seems pretty impressed since he has never see anybody 
recover this fast from the Slave Crown. Then outside guards and hounds beat 
on the door as they demand for the girl and the Empire's Magitek armor. She 
appears to be a member of the Empire, but Terra doesn't seem to recall 
anything about it. The old man decides to help Terra out as he lets her out 
the back door. Outside make your way to the west part of town and inside the 
western mines or Narche is a save point, so save your game and continue on. 

At the top there is a treasure chest containing a PHEONIXDOWN, after picking 
it up continue through and pick up a SLEEPING BAG and continue your way 
through, when you reach to a certain point Narche guards come after you as 
they corner Terra, but she falls to the floor below. At the bottom floor she 
faints, but a flashback occurs. A mysterious man named Kefka has just put on 
the Slave Crown on Terra and sets Terra to battle in Magitek armor as she
easily dismantles the soldiers. The next scene takes place towards the
outside castle of the Empire as Emperor Gestahl has a keen interest in magic 
and wants to forcefully take everything that he thinks belongs to him. Terra 
is still unconsious, and the scene shifts towards the Old man's house as a 
mysterious man is shocked to hear what the old man thought he was doing:

  "Treasure Hunter and trail-worn traveler, searching the world over for
   relices of the past..."

Here you will be given the chance to name your character and this will be the 
only time that you can name your character. Once again leave the default name 
or give it Dingo. Te scene shifts back to Locke, he doesn't prefer robbing, 
but Treasure Hunter. The old man called for Locke to meet with a woman, but 
Locke doesn't want anything to do with the imperial Magitek-riding witch. The 
town alone is too weak to take on the empire as the imperial troops are 
persuing Terra as they speak, and their independence can only be assured if 
they join forces with the Returners, an underground resistance movement. 

Terra was not responsible for her actions and they must get Terra to join 
with them. Locke finally agrees and the old man tells him to make his way to 
Figaro and talk to the king. The scene shifts towards Terra as Locke comes to 
her rescue, but there are many imperial troops to deal with and it doesn't 
look like Locke can take them all himself, but WAIT! Kupo! Its them! Moogles 
are here to help Locke. Here a small scene shows up as a brief and 
descriptive speech by the moogle tells you how to switch between groups by 
pressing the "Square" button(Y button for SNES), your job is to save Terra 
from the imperial guards or else. 

Now make your way down and take out as many imperial troops as you can. It 
doesn't matter if you lose because you will hae two other groups to use, and 
the party that was swooned earlier is automatically revived, but to minimal 
HP. After defeating all of the impreial soldiers talk to the commander and a
boss fight will ensue.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS BATTLE: Marshal & Lobo(2)      HP: 27(Lobo) 420(Marshal)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aw schnap! Its that music again! This boss battle is fairly easy, first take 
out the Lobos so they don't give you anymore trouble, and then use your 
physical attacks on Marshal. His physical attacks hurt a lot, and you really 
can't do much about his Charge attack which will do about 110 HP of damage. 

After the battle Locke thanks the moogles for their help and he carries off 
Terra and takes her outside as he switches a hidden path. Terra then wakes 
up, but she still can't remember a thing. Locke says she's safe with him 
until her memory returns and he says the secret passage might be useful 
someday, DON'T FORGET ABOUT IT! You can walk back to the old man's house if 
you want, but the imperial troops won't let you get through, so you might as 
well hightail it southwards to Figaro. Also take this time to talk to the man 
to the left for admitance to the Beginner's House if your low on HP and if 
you need help on some of the specs of the game and how it works. A very good 
descriptive presentation is explained here! After your down head towards 
Figaro.

=============================================================================
ONWARDS TO FIGARO!
Items: Phoenix Down, Antidote, Soft, Tonic
Party: Locke, Terra
Party's level: 6
=============================================================================

Now keep going southwest until you find a giant desert and the Castle of
Figaro should be right in the middle of the desert. Inside make your way to 
the middle of the castle and find the king as the guards will not allow you 
admitance to any other parts of the castle as they tell you to go see the 
king. When you reach the king Locke tells a little about her to the king and 
he gives a quick and rather seductively dumbfounded look at her, Terra gets a 
bit angry and the king apologizes.

  "The young king of Figaro Castle, ally to the Empire, and a master designer
   of machinery..."

Here you will be given the chance to name your character, but don't name him 
anything stupid, just give him Dingo or Edgar. Surprised that someone like 
Locke knows royalty? The king doesn't care if Terra is an imperial soldier, 
the kingdom of Figaro and the Empire are allies. There are three reasons why 
Edgar is helping Terra, "First of all, your beauty has captivated me!" 
"Second...I'm dying to know if I'm your type..." "I guess 
your...abilities...would be a distant 3rd." Terra still doesn't know what 
Edgar is talking about, she knows a normal girl would find him dashing, but 
she's hardly normal. 

Now is your chance to wander around the castle, don't forget to pick up a 
PHEONIXDOWN, TONIC, SOFT, and a ANTIDOTE. When you talk to the Matron in the 
castle he tells you that Edgar had a twin brother, the scene flashes back to 
Edgar's recent pass not that much long ago as the two talk about his father's 
successor. Edgar refuses to talk about it:

  "Edgar's twin brother, who traded the throne for his own freedom..."

Now is your chance to name the twin brother of Edgar, go with the default so 
you can follow this walkthrough a bit more easier. It appears that Sabin has 
ran away now and the Matron wonders what he is up to right now. Also when you 
check the dungeon do you recognize anybody down there? Yes its the Lone Wolf 
from Final Fantasy V! After checking the castle out and GETTING A GOOD 
NIGHT'S REST talk to Edgar in his throne room, and in the middle of the 
conversation one of the members from the Empire are here to see King Edgar, 
probably Kefka! 

The scene shifts towards Kefka, he's a wierd guy and hates Edgar for living 
in the middle of nowhere and he has sand on his boots, but the imperial 
soldiers quickly wipe his boots clean. HEre have Edgar talk to the soldiers 
before talking to Kefka. IT appears that Kefka wants a girl of no importance 
to return back to the empire and he heard that she has found refuge in Figaro 
Castle. Edgar knows who he is talking about, but Kefka denies it and says she 
stole something of minor value. Edgar doesn't know if she is here or not 
since there are more girls here than grains of sand, and Kefka warns him that 
he better pray for his precious Figaro Castle. 

After Kefka leaves go back and talk with Locke, Edgar tells Locke to show 
Terra to her room as he has some strategic strategies that needs to be dealt 
with. So have Terra follow Locke to her room. She finally knows his name 
which is Locke, and it appears that Edgar has told Terra that he was a thief.

That's Treasure Hunter! Superficial wise, Edgar is allies with the Empire but 
on the inside he is collaborating with the Returners, a small organization 
opposed to the Empire. Terra doesn't understand what she should do, but Locke 
comforts her. But how will Terra know which is the right way? The scene then 
shifts to Edgar, he rushes outside and sees the castle on fire and it was the 
Empire's doing. 

Here Kefka enters in he wants the girl now, but Edgar pretends to not know 
what Kefka is talking about. Now talk to the soldier at the top and Edgar 
tells him to get ready, Kefka wonders if he has changed his mind yet and it 
appears that he has no choice, then quickly rushes and calls his chocobos and
he tells Locke and Terra to jump. The castle is slowly sinking down into the 
sand and Kefka is a bit wounded but nonetheless fine. He orders his men to 
attack the party.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS BATTLE: M-TekArmr(2)      HP: 210(each)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This battle should be pretty hard since your attacks are cut down in half due 
to the armor on the Magitek armors. If Terra uses magic in this battle Edgar 
will become shocked, as will Locke once he finally figures out what magic is. 
Terra thanks Locke and Edgar for not making such a big deal out of it, but 
they seem to go into a swoon state after she thanks them(ha! Losers!)! 
Basically in this battle have Terra use magic and have Edgar use his Tools 
and Locke attack regularly.
  
After the battle they escape and Kefka is a bit pissed off. Terra seems a bit 
scared of Kefka, but Edgar has someone who he wants her to meet. Their mentor 
Banon would certainly want to meet Terra as "Magic" is going to be the key to 
winning this war. No human is ever born with these powers as Terra stops to 
think. Edgar apologizes and tells her that if the Empire captures her again 
the world is done for. Then he tells him to head for the South Figaro cave. 
Here you will notice the amazing power the SNES has in terms of graphics in 
which you will see a semi-3-D view of the world map. Head for the cave south 
of Figaro Castle to the South Figaro cave. When you enter the cave, Edgar 
tells the soldier to go back to the castle and tell everyone that he and the 
party are safe.

=============================================================================
JOURNEY TO SOUTH FIGARO
Items: Phoenix Down, Tincture(2)
Party: Terra, Locke, Edgar
Party's level: 7
=============================================================================

Inside here you will see the a tiny little turtle, ignore it and check the
recovery spring to completely heal your ailments or wounds then continue onto 
the next room. In this room there is a room to the left which contains a 
TINCTURE, don't pick it up though. Trust me. At the bottom right corner of 
the cave pick up a TINCTURE and to the left pick up a PHEONIXDOWN and then 
continue through to the next room and it should lead out of the cave of South 
Figaro.

=============================================================================
SOUTH FIGARO
Items: Green Cherry, Warp Stone, 1500GP, 500GP, 1000GP, Elixir, Tonic(3),
       Antidote, Soft, Hyper Wrist, Running Shoes, Phoenix Down, Tincture,
       Eyedrop
Party: Terra, Locke, Edgar
Party's level: 8
=============================================================================

In this town you will see a cloaked figure, he will head for the pub. In the 
pub when Locke tries to talk to him he recives no comply, but Edgar quickly 
backs him away as he seems a bit familiar.

  "He owes allegiance to no one, and will do anything for money. He comes 
   and goes like the wind..."

Here you will get the chance to name this mysterious figure as Shadow or 
Dingo(yes that's right you have no choice!). Edgar tells Locke that his name 
is Shadow and he would slit his mother's throat for a nickel! Now when you 
head for the Relic shop another descriptive presentation is presented by a 
moogle about Relics. After purchasing a Relic or two head for the docks in 
the southwestern part of South Figaro and you will find a crate that contains 
a SOFT. At the top tier of South Figaro there are three barrels, the bottom 
one contains a WARP STONE and head out of town and east to Mt.Kolts.

=============================================================================
MT.KOLTS AND THE TWIN BROTHER
Items: Atlas Armlet, Tent(2), Guardian, Tonic
Party: Edgar, Terra, Locke
Party's level: 8
=============================================================================

In this mountain continue to make your way across to the top of the mountain. 
When you reach outside to the higher tier take the door to the right and 
follow the path to the otherside of the mountain and you will notice a 
mysterious figure jump back into hiding. Follow him and along the way pick up 
a TENT as well, then continue on and when you find a rope bridge the 
mysterious figure who looks like Shadow, but is not wanders off. There is a 
save point across the bridge so save your game and heal your wounds with a 
TENT if any. 

Then continue on to the outside of the mountain and you will have to walk a 
spiral like path and at the end there is someone blocking the entrance to the
next cave. Its Vargus, the one who you heard about in town of South Figaro, 
but he attacks the party because he thought Sabin sent him. It was actually 
him that was shadowing the party earlier and the fight ensues.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS BATTLE: Vargas & Ipooh      HP: 360(Ipooh) 11600(Vargas)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This battle will be tough, first take out the two Ipooh because you can't
attack Vargas without destroying them. Use Edgar's AutoCrossbow and have
Locke attack regularly and have Terra use magic. After losing Vargas about 
900 HP of damage Sabin will come in. He was jealous that Sabin was chosen the 
as the successor, but actually the master wanted Vargas to be his successor. 
Vargas thinks Sabin is lying and he attacks the party with Blizzard Fist, the 
other three party members fly away, but Sabin still stands. Just keep 
attacking him in this battle, after a while a message will tell you to use 
your Blitz technique doing left, right, left, and then the X button. You can 
use your Aurabolt in this battle(its a Hadouken motion facing left), but it 
doesn't affect him. After using Pummel Vargas is awed by the power of Sabin, 
if only Vargas hadn't been in such a rush for power.

After the battle the brothers are re-united once again, but Terra thought he 
was some bodybuilder strayed from the gym. Sabin laughs and takes it as a 
compliment. Edgar is heading towards the Sabil mountains, but Sabin had been 
watching from afar and it appears that Figaro will be the Empire's next 
target. Now that Sabin has joined the party he will provide some added power 
to the party. Now continue onto the next cave and inside pick up a TENT and 
continue on.

=============================================================================
TO STOP THE EMPIRE WE NEED THE RETURNERS!
Items: Potion, Air Lancet, Phoenix Down(2), Antidote, White Cape, Green
       Cherry, True Knight
Party: Sabin, Terra, Locke, Edgar
Party's level: 10
=============================================================================

In here the guard at the door will lead you to Banon. It appears that Terra 
has decimated 50 of the top soldiers of the Empire in minutes. Then Banon 
tells of a story that there was a box that someone was told never to open, 
but went ahead and opened the box anyways. He had released the evils of the
world, Envy...Pride(?)...Greed...Violence...Control... All that was left in 
the box was a single stray of light: Hope. And Terra is the last ray of 
light, Hope. 

After a short while Terra wakes up, now go talk to Locke. He joined the 
Returners because someone that meant so much to him was locked up and he 
realized that the empire was rotten and heartless and he wanted to make a 
difference. Terra feels a bit down because she has no "significant" other in 
her life, but there are many others who are counting on her. After talking to 
everybody in your party(Locke, Sabin, and Edgar) the guard at the door will 
let you through. Outside here is Banon and he asks if you will be there last 
ray of Hope. If you comply no, he will give you another few moments to make 
your decision, but if you comply yes, he will be happy to hear your decision, 
but Terra is a bit scared.

Banon decides to give Terra a relic which is the GUANTLET, and Banon has a 
plan and asks Terra to get everyone together. In the meeting the facts are 
already known, the Empire is using Magitek power in battle, but hwo did they 
acquire it? It appears that Locke found out that the Empire is forcing the 
world's finest scholars to study the Espers, and there appears to be a 
connection between Magitek and Espers. The ancient War of the Magi probably 
had something to do with this, a theory was developed that humans and 
machines were imbued with the powers drain from the Espers. 

They can only fight Magitek ower with Magitek weapons, and if Terra can speak 
to the Esper and have it wake up. She reluctantly agrees, but then suddenly a 
Returner collapses from his journey of South Figaro. It appears that the 
Empire has taken South Figaro and are heading this way. Locke will sneak into 
South Figaro to slow down the Empire, and tells Terra to stay away from a 
nameless king(Edgar) and Sabin can't believe Edgar hasn't even grown up yet. 

The rest of the party will escape down towards Lete river towards Narche so 
that Terra can speak with the Esper. Now don't forget to pick up the treasure
chests you left behind in the Returners' base which include a POTION, 
PHEONIXDOWN(also note when you pick this up a guy Sleep talking will tell the 
party that the Empire is attacking, but not yet), AIR LANCET, another 
PHEONIXDOWN, and a TRUE KNIGHT relic. Now you might want to save your game 
before heading to the Lete river, afterwards continue on to Narche.

=============================================================================
PROTECT BANON NOW!
Items: None
Party: Edgar, Banon, Terra, Sabin
Party's level: 10
=============================================================================

Here the objective is simple, get Banon to Narche without getting him 
swooned, if he becomes swooned you will have to start over again. And the
battles are not random encounters mind you, they happen at specific points in 
the river, but its useless to tell you anyways. There will be a point in 
which you will have to select the direction where you want to head off. It
doesn't matter which path you pick since due to the fact that they all lead
to the same place, but however each path is a bit different and some of the 
paths lead to treasures, but these battles here can gain Banon levels 
quickly. At the end of this path is Ultros, who is obviously attack your 
party.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS BATTLE: Ultros     HP: 3100
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This battle is a bit tough, but the party should be more than able to take 
out the trash. Have Banon use Health to heal the party and have Sabin use 
either the Aurabolt(there will be a sudden pause in between during the PSX 
version if you use this) or Pummel. Have Terra attack with magic or have her 
use her physical attack and have Edgar use his AutoCrossbow. There is very 
little that you can do about his Tentacle attack which does about 230 HP of 
damage, and he can spread this attack as well, but make sure you keep Banon 
alive. After the battle Ultros escapes and Sabin jumps in after the octopus.

After the battle Sabin floats off the other direction while Terra and Edgar 
head off towards Narche while protecting Banon. Sabin however has floated off 
towards the unknown lands and how is Locke doing after breaking through South 
Figaro's defenses? Its all up to you as here you will choose a 
scenario(pretty neat huh? Instead of having one direction to go to, the game 
lets you decide!). You can pick either one as that scenario you choose 
happens at the exact same time the other ones do, don't worry though you will 
have the opportunity to complete all three scenarios. I will choose Sabin's 
scenario, so if you want you can follow where I'm going or choose the other 
one, it really doesn't matter. You can scroll down to A,B, or C since you 
will have the chance to complete all events...I'll start with A, then B, then
C.

=============================================================================
A: SABIN AND THE UNKNOWN LANDS
Items: None
Party: Sabin
Party's level: 10
=============================================================================

Here there is a house to the right, go inside and talk to Shadow. He will 
offer to show you the way to Doma Castle, which is the Empire's next target. 
Now head southeast and you should find a bridge and on the bridge is the 
Imperial Camp. Here before Shadow and Sabin can do anything thye must hide 
themselves because there are too many imperial soldiers. The two overhear the 
soldiers talking about if Kefka runs General Leo out of the battalion then he 
will become the next general. 

Kefka then comes in and tells the soldiers to do their jobs, but Soldier B 
likes to tell Kefka in his face that he is no General Leo. "Shhhh! Do I 
always have to tell you to keep it down? You're hopeless...!" Then the 
commander tells the soldiers that they are ready to assault Doma Castle. The 
army raids the castle but has trouble getting. It seems hopeless, but a 
mysterious man wants the honor of stopping this atrocity: (Cyan's music theme 
sure is sweet, why the heck wasn't this on the Music CD?)

  "Faithful retainer to his family's liege, with the courage and strength of
  a hundred men..."

Here you will once again have to name the new character in the game, name him 
Cyan so that you can follow along with this walkthrough a bit more clearer. 
Now have Cyan talk to the Commander and a fight will start.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS BATTLE: Leader    HP: 300    ITEM: Black Belt(relic)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This really isn't a boss battle since the theme doesn't play, but it has the 
boss battle atmosphere. Use your Swdtech at level 2 and your counter attack 
(which does close to 700 HP of damage! Dang, he does have the strength of a 
hundred men!). 

After the battle the troopers see that the commander has been defeated and 
they all flee for their lives. The scene then shifts towards Shadow and Cyan. 
Defeat the guard to the bottom left for fun if you want, but check the 
treasure chest inside the tent to the right and there is a treasure chest, 
you can either hit it, kick it, or leave it. If you kick it its pretty funny 
to watch Shadow's reaction, but a sentry will come and Shadow and Sabin hide. 
After the guard leaves you can now pick up the STAR PENDANT. Continue on, but 
as the party spots General Leo they hide and overhear the conversation. 

The soldier wants to raid the castle immediately, but if they do that too 
many costly lives will be wasted, but the soldier insists as he is willing to 
sacrifice his life for the Empire, but General Leo being somewhat warm 
hearted does not want that, nor does Emperor Gestahl. As General LEo is 
called back to the Empire he leaves the task of Doma Castle to a soldier's 
hands. However Kefka plans to poison the water, the soldier questions his 
actions, but since General Leo is gone he decides to poison the water 
anyways. But before Kefka leaves Shadow and Sabin confront him. A quick 
battle ensues, but Kefka runs off, the party chases after him again and 
another battle ensues. 

Chase him again, but this time he will leave a few soldiers for you to deal 
with. It appears that the party is too late and the river has been 
contaminated with poison, the guards at Doma Castle are falling one by one as 
Cyan notices something odd about the water, Cyan tells the guard to guard the 
liege as he goes and finds out what has happened to the king. When Cyan 
reaches their he has collapsed and his vision is going fast and he thanks 
Cyan for guarding the castle since his father was on the throne. The king 
tells Cyan to see his family as he dies on the floor in front of him. Cyan 
and the last sentry goes over the castle to look for any survivors. 

Now have Cyan search around the castle, when he finds his wife Elayne and his 
son Owain dead by the poison he is struct with a sense of denial, not 
believing any of this. He then takes his anger towards the Empire, he fights 
the soldiers as Sabin and Shadow come in just the nick of time to help them. 
So go BEHIND Cyan and talk to him and Sabin and Shadow will lend him a hand. 
After the battle Cyan will attack the other soldiers as well, so lend him a 
hand. Then another battle occurs, so lend him another hand. 

After the battle Sabin tells Cyan that they must leave immediately, so Sabin 
forces Cyan into the Magitek armor and teaches him a little bit of how it 
works. A guard comes out and tries to stop the two but Cyan rams him over 
along with the other guards as well. When you try to escape you will be 
confronted by a few soldiers in Magitek armor. After defeating them the party 
heads for Narche through the forest to the south.

=============================================================================
A2: TO NARCHE!
Items: Phoenix Down(2), Sniper Sight, Earrings, Hyper Wrist
Party: Sabin, Cyan, Shadow
Party's level: 12
=============================================================================

Here go across the bridge and to another bridge, you can go to Doma castle if 
you want but the Soldiers in front won't allow you to pass through. When you 
reach the Phantom Forest you will really see the power of the SNES(well they 
still impress me up to this day!) in terms of graphics, its like whereever 
Square goes they can take advantage of each system's hardware, so imagine the 
PS2! In here its pretty straight forward as at the end of the forest you will 
reach Doma's railway. Maybe there are survivors in here, so the party decides 
to take a look. 

When Cyan tries to stop Sabin from entering in the train he cries out to 
leave the place because the train is haunted. Then suddenly the train moves, 
but the party cannot leave. The train sends the departed to the other side,
but Sabin still has things to do in his life. Outside the train you can 
really see the power of the Mode 7 graphics on the SNES, sweet huh? To the 
right is a box car connected to the train. Inside is the Impresario who will 
tell you about the train and how to stop it. It appears that you will need to 
go to the engine room to the far left to stop the train. 

So go to the far left but talk to the ghost in the box car and he will join 
you if you allow him to. In the other box cars there are ghosts wandering 
around, try to talk to them and they will attack you, but sometimes they may 
even sell stuff. When you reach the box car without a door to the left inside 
a ghost will block the entrance to which you came, defeat it and outside a 
bunch of ghosts will tell you the there is N.O.E.S.C.A.P.E. So climb up the 
ladder of the box car and to the left end of the box car. 

Sabin will jump all the way through to box cars, but as they reach the next 
box car the ghosts still follow them. They will have to detatch the boxcars, 
so go inside to the left and hit the switch and the boxcar will detatch. 
After the boxcars detatch go back inside the hit the switch again and the 
door to the left will open for you and there is also a save point, so save 
your game and heal your wounds. Now in the next boxcar there are two ghosts 
at the end of the left side of the train who tell you to wait at the table 
for food, so go to the middle table of the box car and be seated on the chair 
and the food will come as Sabin takes down the food as everybody is healed of 
all status ailments and their MP/HP are fully recovered. 

Not bad eh? Now go outside and around the boxcar and don't forget to pick up 
that treasure chest which contains the EARRINGS relic. Now in the next boxcar 
there is a treasure chest inside the room, but as the party tries to pick it 
up a mysterious man named Ziegfried won't let the party have the treasure 
chest. After exchanging some rather funny remarks a fight ensues.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS BATTLE: Ziegfried    HP: 50     ITEM: Green Cherry
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes that's right folks only 50 HP. He will start the battle having eight 
consecutive slashes against your party but all the slashes only do damage in 
the single digits. Just attack him and he should be gone in no time.

After the battle Ziegfried takes the treasure chest and runs off. Guess like 
he has the last laugh. Now continue on, the next room has nothing inside so 
continue onto the next boxcar. Here the right room of the boxcar also has 
nothing inside and the Impresario is in this box car as well. In left room of 
the boxcar contains four treasure chests, the one on the left contains a 
HYPER WIST which is guarded by a rather powerful Specter. The treasure chest 
2nd from the left contains a PHEONIXDOWN, the treasure chest 3rd from the 
left contains a SNIPER SIGHT, and the treasure chest to the right contains 
another PHEONIXDOWN. 

After picking those up continue onto the next boxcar, before you go inside 
the boxcar the ghost you picked up earlier(IF you picked him up) will leave 
your party. In this next box car there is a save room, so save your game and
heal your wounds if any and continue on. In the next boxcar, which is the 
engine room there are three switches, hit the left and right switches while 
ignoring the middle switch and go outside to the left of the engine room and 
hit the somke switch. When you do the Phantom Train will talk to you and a 
fight will ensue.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS BATTLE: GhostTrain     HP: 1900     ITEM: TENT
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: Another tip from Earthq:

  "You can kill off the Phantom Train using a Revivify.  (Same with any other
   undead monster.  Life spells work too.)"

  Incase you don't have any Revivifies...then follow below...

Here in this battle have Edge, I mean Shadow throw his Shurikens if you do 
have any or if you did purchase some from one of the ghosts. Have Cyan yse 
his Swdtech level 2 Retort and if the Ghost Train hits Cyan it will recieve a 
painful counter attack. Have Cyan use his Aurabolt and keep your HP up above 
170. The GhostTrain will use powerful attacks especially the Scar Beam(the 
special effects slow the screen down a bit on the PSX version, but they do 
look awesome!) which can deal about 150 HP of damage to every character.
  
After the battle the Phantom Train will let you go but there is something
that he first must do. The train stops and the deceased board the train but 
Cyan also sees Elayne and Owain board the train as well, Sabin tries to stop 
Cyan, but Cyan rams over Sabin. Cyan feels a lot of emotion seeing his family 
go, but his wife tells him never to forget her as his son will protect his 
mother. Now afterwards head for Narche via the cave to the east.
  
=============================================================================
THE TRIP TO NARCHE VIA THE BAREN FALLS
Items: None
Party: Shadow, Sabin, Cyan
Party's level: 14
=============================================================================

Here the party can reach Narche through the Veldt if they jump into the
waterfall, also Shadow leaves here as well. So jump into the waterfall and in 
the waterfall you will have to face off against several Piranha, but they can 
be easily defeated with Sabin's Pummel and Cyan's Dispatch. At the end of the 
Piranha attack a Rizopas will attack you, and follow the same drill as 
before. After winning the battles you recieve a REMEDY.

After the battles you will drift and a new character is introduced.

  "Draped in monster hides, eyes shining with intelligence. A youth surviving
   against all odds..."

This is once again your only time to name the character anything you want,
leave it at Gau. Here Gau saves the two from drowning, and when Sabin asks
who he is Gau runs off. Now head for the east town of Mobliz.

=============================================================================
THE TOWN OF MOBLIZ
Items: Elixir
Party: Sabin, Cyan
Party's level: 14
=============================================================================

Here when you walk towards Mobliz you will encounter some battles, but the 
enemies here don't give you any expierience points, all they give is gold and 
sometimes Gau will appear at the end of the battle, but he will just leave. 
Mobliz is towards the east part of the continent. Inside here head for the 
items shop and purchase some DRIED MEAT, you can buy some new weapons if you 
like but that's not neccessary. Now head out into the Veldt which is the area 
outside of Mobliz and fight a battle and hopefully at the end of the battle 
Gau will come, if not just keep on fighting until he does. 

When you encounter Gau feed him some DRIED MEAT, he still wants more food. 
However Sabin refuses to give him anymore food as he gets a bit angry and Gau 
starts to chase Sabin around until Sabin gets tired. Cyan afterwards becomes 
silent until Sabin tells Gau that his family was just, and Gau apologizes. It 
appears that Gau wants to give the party something in return for their 
gratitude of food. He takes the party over to Cresent Mountain. Afterwards an 
Imp comes in and gives a short but descriptive demonstration of how Gau's 
abilities work. After the battle head over to Cresent Mountain which is to 
the south.

=============================================================================
CRESENT MOUNTAIN AND GAU'S SHINY, SHINY, SHINY TREASURE
Items: X-Potion, Elixir, Green Beret
Party: Gau, Sabin, Cyan
Party's level: 14
=============================================================================

Here inside Gau pops out and looks for the Shiny thing and it appears that
Gau has forgotten where he saw the shiny thing! So now the party decides to 
look around. Now walk around, when you reach the top left of the cave Gau 
will pruposely drop Sabin's pouch which contained 500 GP inside, before Sabin 
gets agitated Cyan decides to take things over for now. As you progress 
farther nside the cave, Gau will have found the shiny thing that he was 
talking about earlier. It seems like a helmet of some sort that allows the 
wearer to breath underwater. 

Gau seems a bit scared of the water as he is hydrophobic, but Sabin and Cyan 
laugh at him. The two jump and Gau finally decides to jump. Here you will be 
underwater and yes those are the graphics from the SNES, prety neat huh? 
Underwater here there are no random encounters as all these battles must be 
fought if you wish to pass through. Watch for the Anguiform, it's AquaRake 
attack will do over 200 HP of damage to every character so keep your HP up 
and above 230 just to be safe. When the arrows show up take the right, and
you will later be inside a cave with a treasure chest that includes the
X-POTION. 

After that head outside and you will be along the current of the river again, 
and then later to another cave which contains nothing, however if you are 
wounded now is the time to heal your wounds instead of doing that in battle. 
Now in the next room there is a small pond, as you try to head out the door, 
the entire pond drains itself, so enter the pond and you will be taken down 
to the bottom floor to pick up a treasure chest which contains a GREEN BERET 
helmet. Now continue on to the bottom and you will be floating through the 
currents again, but this time they will take you to South Figaro. You will 
wake up on the docks of South Figaro, so take the ferry by talking to the man 
on the boat to Narche. Now you will be given the chance to choose another 
scenario you want to complete. I'll go with Locke's scenario this time.

=============================================================================
B: THE ESCAPE FROM SOUTH FIGARO AND CELES
Items: Elixir, Ether, Ribbon, Earrings, Regal Cutlass, Iron Armor, X-Potion
Party: Locke
Party's level: 7-8
=============================================================================

Here you see the Locke needs to find a way out fast. Don't talk to any
imperial soldiers on Magitek armor because you have little chance of beating 
them(unless you have a Gameshark!), but even if you lose you won't have to 
start over again. Now head inside the item shop and talk to the merchant near 
the clock, he will cause Locke a thief but if he doesn't call him Treasure 
Hunter Locke will rip his lungs out. Then a fight will ensue, this battle is 
way too easy, but use the Steal command and you will steal his clothes! 

Now that you are dressed like a merchant head for the house down below and 
talk to the kid that was previously blocking your path and he will let you 
through. Now go outside the house and talk to green officer at the top left 
part on the balcony of the town. In this battle use the Steal command and 
steal his clothing and you will now be able to get through to the inn. Talk 
to the guard that was blocking your path towards the inn and he will let you 
through since he thought it was time for his break. Head for the inn and go 
to the basement floor and talk to the merchant, he thinks your trying to
steal his cider so a fight ensues. 

Defeat him normally if you want but steal clothes this time because you will 
need to head back through that house the kid was blocking again. After the 
battle you will have taken the old man's cider, go to the house where the kid 
was blocking your path and saying that only merhants can pass through and at 
the top floor give the old man his cider and he will give you some 
information about a hidden passage and he also forgot the password, but talk 
to his grandson down stairs and the password is "Courage" and after giving 
him the password a hidden path will open up for you. 

Inside make your way downstairs and it will take you to the underground 
passage through to the manor's house. In here check the clock for an ELIXIR 
and then head outside and around into the manor's house and head for the 
first room from the left upstairs and go behind the bookshelf and it will 
lead to a secret passage. Down here there are some pretty strong enemies, you 
might want to avoid them. As you continue on Locke will stop by the 
approaching door and notices someone familiar, its one of the Empire's 
generals. Inside the romm the guard continuously hits the general for being a 
traitor:

  "Product of genetic engineering, battle-hardened Magitek Knight, with a
   spirit as pure as snow..."

Here you will be given the only chance in the game to name this character
anything you want, but leave it at the default so that you can follow the
storyline a bit easier. Afterwards Celes is knocked out cold to the floor and 
the guard tells the other guard to watch over her. Outside Locke is hiding 
and when the guard leaves he jumps down. Head inside the room and you will 
notice that the guard is sleeping, talk to Celes and remove her chains.

Afterwords they introduce themselves, Locke doesn't care if she was a general 
and allows her to come with him, but she refuses, but Locke promises that he 
will protect her. So she finally agrees Locke leaves, but not before checking 
the soldier and take the Clock Key, you'll startle the guard a bit but he 
quickly goes back to sleep. Now head out and into the next room and inside is 
a save point, so save your game and heal your wounds if any. Now continue 
onto the next room and inside there are 3 treasure chests 500 GP, 1500 GP, 
and one that is empty. 

I suggest that you leave the empty one alone, so if you did check the 
treasure chest reset your game and don't pick up that empty treasure chest. 
Now check the clock above and wind the clock and a secret passage will open. 
Now head on through and in this next area pick up the treasure chests in the 
room which contain a IRON ARMOR, EARRINGS relic, HEAVY SHLD, and a 
REGALCUTLASS. Now head for the upper staircase to the top right, and before 
you head out Celes wonders why Locke is trying to help her, he does so 
because she reminds her of someone. 

Now head outside and into the Sotuh Figaro cave. Work your way around the 
place, but remember the room where you had a treasure chest containing a 
TINCTURE? If you did not pick up the TINCTURE earlier you can go back and 
pick up a THUNDER ROD. If you did pick up the treasure chest earlier then 
obviously there would be nothing there. As you make your way out Locke will 
finally notice a wierd noise emitting in the cave. But before the two can 
make their way out something coming out of the wall attacks them.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS BATTLE: TunnelArmr     HP: 1300    ITEM: Elixir
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This boss will be pretty tough. Have Celes use her Runic command so that all 
magic used from the TunnelArmr will be avsorbed as MP points. Have Locke 
attack as normal and keep your HP up and above 100. If you have the THUNDER 
ROD, use it and he's gone with a snap of a finger. Don't worry if you lose 
though, this boss is tough anyways. But if you are playing the PSX version 
you might not want to lose since you will have to deal with the bad loading 
time anyways!

After the battle the two head for Narche and now its time to choose the last 
scenario.

=============================================================================
C: BANON AND THE KEFKA ASSAULT
Items: Rune Edge, Earrings, 5000 GP, Elixir, Theif Knife, Wall Ring, Sneak
       Ring, Hyper Wrist
Party: Banon, Edgar, Terra
Party's level: 10
=============================================================================

Here this scenario takes place where it last left off. The party still rides 
the rapids and also more battles have to be fought. After a short battle the 
party arrives at Narche and just in the nick of time. When the party reaches 
inside Narche guards block their path, Banon tries to settle them down but 
they knock him out. Edgar tells them that he is king but they don't believe 
him and knock him out as well. Each time you try to go through the guards 
will just knock you back, but remember the secret passage that Locke told you 
to remember about when he got Terra out? Head towards that area, its to the 
very left if you had forgotten. 

As you make your way to the next cave there will be a light that goes a 
certain path. You will have to go that exact path to escape the security 
checkpoint, so have you been taking your Ginkoba? It will take a few tries 
since due to the fact that its a pretty complex path to remember. Once 
through head for the old man's house from earlier in the game, but you are 
welcomed to stop by the moogle's cave if you want to. In the moogle's cave 
don't forget to pick up the RUNE EDGE, then leave because there isn't much 
you can do here now. Head for the old man's house and inside you will get a 
bit of info of what has been happening around Narche. 

Its neutral for now and many people haven't really wanted to side with the 
Returners. The town has gone a bit worst about the Esper, but Banon thinks 
Terra can reach out to the Esper. However Edgar has second thoughts, either 
the Esper will help them or dig them an early grave. It appears that Narche 
is the next target of the Empire since Emperor Gestahl is after Magitek power 
he will be interested in the Esper. Then Sabin, Cyan, and Gau comes in and 
greets the party, after a briefing about Doma Locke and Celes come in and 
rush to tell the party that Narche is about to be attacked. 

But Cyan becomes very angry as he recognizes Celes as she was the one who 
burned down Maranda, but Locke won't allow Cyan to do so. Terra also reveals 
to Cyan that she was also once an general of the Empire. Then suddenly a 
guard comes in and tells the entire party that Kefka has already begun his 
assault on Narche. The scene shifts to Kefka's army, the soldiers question a 
lot about his actions towards Narche since it is neutral and there are
civilians living in Narche, but Kefka doesn't care he wants everyone dead.

The scene shifts back to the party, it appears that they left the esper at 
the top of the hills. They go after it to defend it, but along the way Celes 
and Terra have a small conversation, and Celes thinks being bron with magic 
is such an incredible gift. Celes can also use magic because when she was 
just a baby she was artificially infused with magic and was raised as a 
Magitek Knight. Terra asks if Celes has ever loved anyone, but Celes doesn't 
know what she is talking about. Cyan however still has a lot of doubt about 
Celes. 

Now when the entire party reaches the top of the hills of Narche you will 
have to form 3 parties with your 7 party members. Your job is to not only 
defend the Esper but Banon as well. If the army reaches Banon then you will 
have to start over again. You will have to fight a lot of battles, probably 
about 20 battles to beat them all. But you can reach Kefka without having to 
destroy his entire army. When you reach Kefka make sure you have Gau in your 
party and then talk to him to initiate the fight.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS BATTLE: Kefka     HP: 3000     ITEM: Peace Ring
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This battle will be ver tough, his poison attack will more than likely knock 
out your party members. But if you have Gau have him use the Were-Rat rage 
and he will absorb all of Kefka's poison attacks, which makes the battle a 
lot easier. Having the relic Star Pendant equipped prior to this battle helps 
out as well as you will not be affected by his poison attack. Having Cyan, 
Gau, and Sabin in this battle really helps. Have Cyan use his 
swdtech(hopefully you are at level 4) at the highest level, and have Sabin 
use his Aurabolt or Suplex if he has it yet. Cyan's multi-hit attack will 
deal a lot of damage in this battle and Gau will take al his poison attacks 
like herbs, and Sabin in this battle will provide the muscle. Attack him, 
attack him, and attack him!

After the battle the party goes for the Esper, Terra senses something from 
the esper as the entire party but Terra is knocked out. Terra communicates
with the esper and asks a few questions about who she is. Then the esper
reveals Terra's true nature, she flies off wildly into the skies. Celes tells 
Locke that Terra looked like an esper, but Edgar knows that they have to find 
her. Now you must form two parties, one to look for Terra and the other to 
stay guard and protect the esper. Afterwards head west to look for Terra 
otuside of Narche.

=============================================================================
THE TOWN OF KOHLINGEN
Items: Hero Ring, Green Beret, Elixir
Party: Locke and whomever
Party's level: 12-14
=============================================================================

Now head back to where the Figaro Castle previously was sunken earlier. The 
reason why its back at its place is because its a castle that is completely 
mechanic, think of it as a SUV and submarine combined, except it can easily 
move through sand. Well here head to the engine room and talk to the ma 
downstairs to the left and he will ask you if you want to go to Kohlingen, so 
do so. When you arrive head for the town of Kohlingen which is just north of 
the Figaro Castle. Inside this town you will get a  lot of information about 
Terra's whereabouts. 

Also check Rachel's house at the top left part of town and inside check the 
grandfather clock for an ELIXIR. Also if you have Locke in your party a short 
scenario will take place here. Locke mentions that he wasn't able to save her 
when she needed him. A flashback takes place with Rachel and Locke in some 
mountain cave and it seems like Locke is searching for something, something 
he also wants Rachel to see. When Locke walks across the platform it begins 
to shake, Rachel unselfishly pushes Locke aside as the platform collapses 
beneath her as she falls to the ground below. 

Later Locke is at her bedside, and when Rachel wakes up she can't remember 
anything. Then Rachel's dad kicks Locke out because he blames him for her 
memory loss, she then comes out and tells Locke to leave, she doesn't even 
know who Locke is and he blames him for getting everybody upset. Locke leaves 
as Rachel will have to make a new start, the scene flashes back to the party. 
After a year Rachel had been killed in an imperial attack. Her memory had 
returned just before she passed away and the last word she said was Locke's 
name. Locke feels that he should have never left her side and he feels that 
it was his fault that she had died. 

Now head for the east house and go downstairs. The man near Rachel had place 
herbs that had put her in suspended animation so that she won't age a day. A 
flashback occurs at the same exact location but this time its in the past, 
and the man had just started to put the herbs on Rachel. Locke wonders if he 
calls her back, that she will come back to her. Then the flashback scene is 
gone and switches back to the current time. Locke still believes that he had 
failed her, he then leaves as does the party. 

So are you wondering how to get to that door atop? Well go outside and enter 
through the back of the house and you should be able to pick up a GREEN BERET 
helmet. You can shop around if you like if you need any updating in your 
weapons and armor. After your done head out of the town and head to the far 
south to Jidoor.

=============================================================================
THE TOWN OF JIDOOR
Items: Tincture
Party: Locke and whomever
Party's level: 12-14
=============================================================================

Here in this town you can visit Ozwer's house which is the giant mansion at 
the north end of this town. Inside check the top right pot for a TINCTURE. 
Also in this town you can check the auction to see if they have anything that 
might interest you LATER IN THE GAME. Right now the auction will always be 
over so you can't bid on anything. The only thing to do here really is to get 
a chocobo to make your way to Zozo, which is the desolate town northeast from 
Jidoor. And that should be your next destination.

=============================================================================
THE SEARCH FOR TERRA
Items: Tonic, Thief Glove, Running Shoes, X-Potion, Tincture, Chain Saw,
       Potion, Fire Knuckle
Party: Locke and whomever
Party's level: 12-14
=============================================================================

Here in this town the place looks dark and dreary and rain is constantly on 
the pour. Also there are random encounters in here as well, the enemies 
aren't really that tough, but like the people of Jidoor, said they can't be 
trusted. Here head for the north part of town and into the inn, there is a 
clock that needs to be reseted, and hopefully you know what time it is.

Everybody should know this, but if you don't its: 6:10:50. That will open up 
a staircase that leads to Edgar's Chain Saw. Afterwards head for the relic 
shop at the bottom left part of town and inside the relic shop owner tells 
you to check the top of the building. So do what he says and head for the top 
of the building, along the way don't forget to pick up the THIEF GLOVE for 
Locke. And then head for the doorless doorway just below and move inside and 
jump to the left building, and then again to the left building. 

Then continue on and inside check the pots in the top left of the room for a 
TINCTURE, and then head outside. And jump two buildings over to the right and 
head inside. In here there are just a series of stairways, continue your way 
through and along the way don't forget to pick up a FIRE KNUCKLE for Sabin. 
Then at the top of the building and talk to the man blocking your path, it 
appears that he hates fighting and he'd better let you pass, but he decides 
to fight you anyways.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS BATTLE: Dadaluma     HP: 3270    ITEM: Headband
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This battle is pretty tough, it will take a lot to defeat this guy. Have 
Edgar use his Chain Saw, you might miss sometimes but you can deal some very 
serious and critical hits with it. Have Cyan attack with Swdtech, have Locke 
use his Capture and steal a JEWEL RING from him, have Celes use her physical 
attacks or magic to heal the party, have Gau use anyone of his Rage attacks 
and finally have Sabin use his Aurabolt blitz. After losing him about 1900 HP 
he will call for two Iron Fists, so quickly dispose of them so they won't 
become much of a nuisance. After you defeat the two Iron Fists Dadaluma will 
use a TONIC, POTION, POTION, and SAFE spell all in one round. Just continue 
your attacks from their and he should be gone.

After the battle head upstairs and into the room, the sides of the room
contain a treasure chest on each side. Check them to recieve an X-POTION and 
a RUNNINGSHOES relic. Then continue towards the center of the room and talk 
to Terra. The party tries to talk to her, but a mysterious voice talks to the 
party. Then Terra goes a bit berserk and finally settles down. Ramuh tells 
the party that Terra cannot understand them as he reveals that he too is an 
Esper. But don't espers live in another world? Yes, but that does not mean 
that they cannot live here too as espers can take on a variety of forms. 

Espers hide themselves from humans because he knows espers and humans cannot 
live together. But Locke's grandfather said that espers and humans once lived 
side by side, and apparently its true. Then came along the War of the Magi, 
it was the espers who fought humans who were infused with magical powers 
extracted from the espers. A flashback now takes place, the espers fearing 
that their magical powers would become a target once again, they moved to a 
new realm and made it their niche. It was 20 years prior to the present time 
of now that humans knew about Magitek power and they hid it from the espers. 
When the espers had found out they created a doorway and exiled the humans. 

Even as Ramuh speaks there are espers trapped in the Empire's Magitek 
facility being drained of their powers. Ramuh fled here to avoid a similar 
fate. He had sensed that Terra was in trouble so his magic summoned Terra to 
Zozo. So is Terra really an esper? Actually no, she's a bit different. 
Terra's presence of existance strikes fear into her own heart, the party 
can't help her, but if she can accept this aspect of herself she will be all
right. Cyan realizes that the party must do something about this, and Ramuh 
tells them to free the other espers imprisoned by Gestahl's Magitek Research 
Facility. 

Ramuh feels that he acted cowardly fleeing and leaving the others to their 
fate. However once the espers transform their powers can be relocated, then 
three magicite comes down from the ceiling as they are the fallen comrades 
that have fled from the Empire. Ramuh will also sacrifice himself as well for 
the sake of other lives. Now talk to the magicite, Ramuh can still talk, but 
after a while he will pass on and lend his power to you. Now pick up all four 
Magicite Ramuh, Stray, Siren, and Kirin. Now as you leave talk to your other
party members near the door. 

The party decides to talk along the way as they exit out of Zozo, they talk a 
bit about the Empire and the party must split into two groups so that they 
can guard Narche and attack the Magitek Research Facility at the same time. 
Celes and Locke will head for the Empire's facility, but you can place one or 
two other party members to go with them as well. The other party that is not 
in Locke's group heads back for Narche, but how will they get there? Maybe 
the people in Jidoor will help them. So now leave to Jidoor, also did you see 
the ghost appear? Talk to it and it will explain a bit about how the esper 
system works exactly. Afterwards go towards Jidoor which is southwest from 
Zozo.

=============================================================================
THE WAY TO THE OPERA HOUSE VIA JIDOOR
Items: None
Party: Celes, Locke and whomever
Party's level: 13-16
=============================================================================

Here when you talk to everyone, previously they had talked about Zozo and the 
thiefs, now they are talking about Maria the Opera Singer and the airship. 
Now go inside Ozwer's House located at the north end and talk to the 
Impresario who mistakes Celes for Maria, but he then finds out that she is 
not the real Maria and leaves. However Celes seems a bit flattered that she 
can relate to the Opera singer Maria. Now as you walk out the Impresario has 
dropped an envelope, examine it and the Master will come in. It appears that 
a mysterious wandering gambler wants Maria as his wife, something which has 
startled the Impresario ever since it has arrived. The scene shifts towards 
the wandering gambler:

  "A blackjack-playing, world-traveling, casino-dwelling free spirit..."

Here you will be given the chance to name the character, so name him Setzer 
and leave it at that. It appears that Setzer is the owner of the world's only 
airship. The party then decides to set up a meeting with Setzer. Now head 
south towards the Opera House.

=============================================================================
SETZER AND A NEAR COSTLY GAMBLE
Items: None
Party: Celes, Locke and whomever
Party's level: 13-16
=============================================================================

Inside the Opera House talk to the Impresario. He tells the party that Setzer 
might appear at the climax of scene 1 as he loves an entrance. That's when 
the party decides to grab him at that time, but that would cost the 
Impresario his job. He wants the play to be a success and does not want Maria 
to be abducted. Then the party decides that they will let Setzer grab Maria, 
but Celes will be the decoy since she looks so much like Maria and that 
should lead them to the airship. Celes however has some doubts because she is 
no Opera Singer, she then runs for the door and shuts it behind her. 

Inside however she practices, but doesn't sound so good as Locke has a laugh 
or two. However at the same time Ultros who is also in the Opera House wants 
to foil their plan by pretending to be Setzer. He lets the letter fly off to 
the party's direction but the party doesn't even notice it as they prepare 
for the play. D'haaaaa! Read it...! Then the scene moves over to the Opera 
play down below, and the Impresario plays out his role while depicting of a 
war between east and west. 

After the short play have Locke head for the dressing room to the right. In 
the dressing room talk to Maria um...I mean Celes. Locke seems too blushed to 
speak to Celes in proper English, but Celes still wonders why Locke had 
helped her back there. He did so because he once abandoned someone when she 
needed him. Afterwards have Celes check the score on the table, and try to 
remember the words, just skim through it, but if you have Ginkoba you'll be 
fine. After you are done head for the stage and the play will start. 

Also note that FFVII' Aeris theme most likely originated from Celes' Opera 
theme. Here you will have to select which part of the play comes next, mess 
up and you will have to start all over again. You will have to control Celes 
for a little bit in this play. Afterwards Celes is downstairs dancing with 
the prince as Locke looks over her.

  NOTE: In the U.S. version of Final Fantasy III, Celes had to remember
        more of the play instead of just selecting one part of the play.
        I think there was about three parts you had to make a decision in.
        Why was it only one decision in Final Fantasy VI? I just don't
        know.

Now leave back to the balcony, but before you do check the letter written by 
Ultros. It appears that we wants to ruin the Opera scene, so Locke better 
tell the impresario quick! The Impresario is startled but the play still goes 
on. Then the scene takes to the top of the play where Ultros has a weight 
ready to drop on Maria, I mean Celes! But it'll take him 5 minutes to drop 
it(odd, why would it take 5 minutes to drop a heavy object?), so that gives 
the party an indication of just how much time they have before they can save 
Celes. 

Talk to the man in the far right and he will help the two get up there. When 
you reach there hit the far right switch and then quickly head to the left 
side, and you will be at the top of the play. However before you can reach 
Ultros there are Vermin and Sewer Rats that will block your path so you will 
need to make the battles quick. 

  NOTE: On the SNES version you don't need to deal with load time like the
        PSX does. Even the load times after and before the battles including
        going through doors the time still runs! No kidding, everytime the
        PSX loads info onto the RAM you lose 2 seconds off the clock! So
        I'm just warning you that your time is much more limited on the PSX
        version than on the SNES version!

Don't worry if you lose the battles though, the Impresario will give you 
three more chances afterwards and all the events prior to Locke reading the 
letter from Ultros you will not have to go through again. When you reach 
Ultros he will push you over the top, when Locke brushes himself off he 
pretends to act along with the play, but oh, what bad acting! But a "lowborn 
thug" could never defeat Ultros(as said by Ultros)! Well since the Impresario 
has no choice he might as well make the most of it, "music!"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS BATTLE: Ultros      HP: 2550
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This battle will be tough, Ultros' Tentacle attack causes critical hits right 
from the start so you will have to keep your HP above 200, and heal 
immediately after he hits you with it. Use all of your powerful attacks 
against him like Dispatch, Aurabolt, Chainsaw, you know just like regular 
boss battles.

  NOTE: In the U.S. version of Final Fantasy III, Ultros splashes as he
        escapes, like if the stage was all water, however on the PSX version
        Ultros escapes regularly. Its odd!

After the battle Setzer finally reveals himself and takes Maria, Ce...Celes, 
that's it! However the Impresario is all giddy about the change in events. 
Afterwards Celes is put inside Setzer's casino room, but the other party 
members including Locke are already on board. Then when Setzer comes in he 
realizes that Maria is not Maria, and if she is not Maria then he does not 
want them onboard since she is not Maria. The party then try to sweet talk 
Setzer into helping them, Setzer sees what the party is getting at here but 
that does not mean that he is willing to help them. 

Now talk to Setzer, and it appears that the Empire has made him a rich man, 
but the party tells them about the cruel deeds of the Empire but Setzer never 
heard about this before. Setzer agrees to help the party if Celes becomes his 
wife, and as you can expect Locke is outraged. Celes however reluctantly 
agrees, but she wants to settle it with a coin toss as heads Setzer helps the 
party and tails she goes with Setzer, and a resounding acknowledgement is 
ajourned by Setzer. 

Celes then flips the coin and it lands on heads, so Celes wins! Setzer then 
picks up the coin and notices soemthing odd about the coin, it has identical 
sides! But Setzer admires that kind of low hustling and he will help the 
party with nothing to lose but his life. The party realize that they will 
have to land the airship a great distance away for obvious reasons and yes 
those graphics do look sweet right?

=============================================================================
THE TOWN OF ALBROOK AND THE SEIGING EMPIRE
Items: Elixir, Potion, Tincture, Warp Stone
Party: Whomever
Party's level: 13-16
=============================================================================

In this town and you will get a bit of information, and check the barrel to 
the far right of this town to the right of the inn to recieve a POTION. The 
town is filled with guards so going to the docks are impossible. Inside the 
pub is a clock, check it to recieve an ELIXIR, afterwards you can check the 
weapons and armor shop if you need anything, otherwise head out.

Vector should be up north, around to the top from where the airship is and
you will have to walk a LONG way. You can steal Tiger Masks from the enemies
that you encounter along the way though.

=============================================================================
TOWARDS VECTOR AND RESCUE OF THE ESPERS
Items: X-Potion, Flame Sabre, Zephyr Cape, Blizzard, Gold Armor, Dragoon
       Boots, Gold Helmet, Thunder Blade, Break Sword, Remedy, Tent
Party: Celes, Locke, and whomever
Party's level: 14-17
=============================================================================

In here buy any weapons and armor that you may need and then talk to the old 
man behind the crates in the center of this room. He will distract the guards 
while the party climbs the box and enters the facility. So when he does climb 
the boxes and around, when you reach behind the guards don't go near them 
otherwise a fight will ensue and you will have to start all over again. Now 
continue towards the top and into the heart of the facility. Do you hear the 
techno type of music? Pretty neat huh with it mixing with the clangs of 
metal. 

Continue towards the left side of the room and take the swinging hook over to 
the left side and also pick up the FLAME SABRE. Then head back to the middle 
of the room and through the pipes to pick up a TINCTURE. Then head for the 
pipe to the left and you will climb down to the lower part of the room. Pick 
up the X-POTION, and go towards the right to pick up the THUNDERBLADE and a
REMEDY. When your done head down to the bottom portion of the facility. At 
the bottom of the facility head towards the lower part of this room and you 
should find a TENT inside a treasure chest and a GOLD HELMET which is located 
at the bottom left of this room. 

Also don't forget to pick up the DRAGOONBOOTS relic at the left side and at 
the top left is a door which leads to a GOLD SHLD. When your done head for 
the walkrail where the Magitek armor is and it will take to the right side of 
the room, but then the party spots Kefka. He has drained the espers of their
powers and throws them to the walkrail that leads to the room below. Follow 
where the espers were thrown off. Here before you talk to the two espers take 
the room to the right and inside is a save point, so save your game and heal 
your wounds if any. When you talk to the espers they will attack you.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS BATTLE: Ifrit     HP: 3300
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this battle make sure that you are not equiped with the FLAME SABRE 
otherwise you will be healing Ifrit. Use Ice on him if you have it and 
hopefully someone did use the DRAGOONBOOTS relic so you can Jump Ifrit and 
also avoid some of his attacks at the same time. In this battle have Cyan use 
his level 4 SwdTech(if you have it, if not use the next best thing), have 
Sabin use his Suplex or Aurabolt, have Edgar attack with his Chain Saw, have 
Locke attack regularly(I suggest you give the DRAGOONBOOTS to Locke), have 
Celes use Ice magic on Ifrit and have Gau use any one of his Rage commands. 
After a while Ifrit will notice that you have Ramuh's powers and Shiva comes 
in and will sacrifice herself as well.

NOTE: Although there is some alternation between Shiva and Ifrit between
      battles, there were several occassional times when I had fought Shiva
      and Ifrit alone.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS BATTLE: Shiva     HP: 3000
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm not sure if you are suppose to fight her, but if you do here are the
strategies. The game's Bonus menu lists her stats so I'm assuming that she is 
a boss, but I never really fought her before. This battle is basically the 
same as above except this time you will have to use Fire attacks obviously 
and equip the FLAME SABRE in this battle. After you defeat her Ifrit will 
come in and realize that you hold Ramuh's powers.

After the battle Ifrit and Shiva have little to live. Talk to the both of 
them and they will do the same thing Ramuh did with his power and entrust it 
into the party. So pick up the Magicite Shiva and Ifrit and continue onto the 
next room, the path Shiva was blocking. In here its just a long series of 
stairs, so make your way to the top. In this next room is the Magitek Res. 
Facility, to the bottom left of this room is a hidden passage which leads to 
a BREAK BLADE. After that continue onto the next room there will be a robot 
in your path. Talk to it and a fight will ensue.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS BATTLE: No. 024     HP: 4777     ITEM: Blizzard spear
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This battle is fairly easy, he has no weaknesses even though he is a machine. 
Attack normally by having Celes attack regularly as with Locke. Have Cyan use 
his Swdtech, Sabin his Blitz, and Gau any of his Rage attacks. Have Edgar use 
his Chain Saw and continue this pattern while keeping your HP above 250.

After the battle continue through to the next room, here go up top and hit 
the switch. The espers doesn't have much long to live as they will 
turn themselves into Magicite. Then Cid comes in and examines the magicite 
and discovers something new about the espers. Then the magicite will break 
out and entrust their power in the party. It appears the Celes and Cid know
each other, and Cid thinks that Celes came here to cause an uprising.

Then Kefka makes his entrance and tells Celes to hand over the magicite 
shards, Locke is shocked to hear this as he thinks Celes has betrayed him. 
Celes however wants Locke to trust her, but he has doubts and then suddenly 
the Magitek troops come in and knock the party out as Celes clings on to the 
side. Celes now wants to protect Locke and maybe then he will believe her, 
she teleports the Magitek troops and Kefka away and she goes with them as 
well. 

Afterwards the contents of the capsules have spilled and the place is about 
to collapse, but he tells the party to quickly follow him. Cid realizes now 
that Kefka was using him and using the Empire and he decides to talk to the 
Emperor to have the war stopped. When you reach the bottom save your game and 
talk to Cid. Cid apparently was the one who raised her, but it was not his 
fault that Celes was forced to become a Magitek Knight and thus has done some 
inconsiderate things.

He feels bad for her and he wishes if he could talk to her and apologize for 
the way things have turned out. Then Kefka's laughter echoes through, Cid 
then pushes the party onto the mine cart and tells the party to escape. 
During the middle of this you will have to fight a couple of battles with 
MagRoaders. At the end of the trail you will encounter the boss of the 
railway.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS BATTLE: Number 128 & Left Blade & Right Blade     HP: 3278(#128) 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Left Blade has 400 HP and the Right Blade has 700 HP. This battle will be 
pretty tough. Attach him constantly with the regular pattern of Cyan's 
Swdtech's, Sabin's Blitz, Gau's Rage, Edgar's Tools and Locke's regular 
attacks. Keep your HP above 280 for this battle and take out the Left Blade 
first and then the Right Blade and then the Number 128.

After the battle the party will crash into a Magitek armor and send both the 
cart and the armor flying! Here another save point opens up, so save your 
game and heal your wounds. Now head out of here and Setzer will meet up with 
you, the scene then shifts towards Kefka who is a bit angry about what just 
had happened. He sends mechanical arms to stop the party from leaving.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS BATTLE: Crane(2)     HP: 1800(Left Crane)  2300(Right Crane)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This boss will be very tough. Go through the regular routine like before but 
in this battle avoid using Fire magic as you will heal the cranes. Also keep 
your HP above 550, the Magnitude8 will cause a lot of damage to your party so 
you might want to watch out for that. Thunder spells work well to the right 
crane but the left crane is strong against that. Both however are weak 
against water attacks, but I don't think that you might even have a water 
spell at this point yet.

After the battle the party escapes from Vector and Locke is a bit worried
about Terra so they decide to head back to Zozo. Inside when the meet with
Terra, locke shows her the magicite. Terra then remembers her past, and it
appears that she was raised in an esper world. The scene flashes back
towards Terra's past, here you will control or reinact what happened. Have
the epser walk around and talk to the other espers and you will find 
someone laying on the ground, pick her up and Maduin(the esper you are
controlling) will take her to a bed for some rest. 

Then talk to the girl that you had saved and she will awaken. Maduin wants 
the girl to keep the pendant that protects the esper world, the espers are 
pretty upset about bringing a human back to health. Maduin however is tired 
of living in the human world, he sees the world as infectous, full of desire 
and greed. Then in the morning the girl had already headed for the gate, head 
for the gate atop. When you find Madonna she wants to leave because humans 
and espers can never co-exist, but how do they know unless they observe for 
themselves?

The two then have a baby, they've given the new born a name...Terra. Then its 
two years later and the troops are after magitek power. Emperor Gestahl wants 
all the espers and offers riches to any one who can capture an esper. 
Meanwhile Maduin and Madonna are looking over their child, then talk to the
Elder. The elder wants to cast a magical seal that will close off the 
humans from the esper world, but in his old state he might pass away, but 
he doesn't care just as long as the rest of the espers are safe. Madonna 
however wants to stay with Maduin. As you leave the esper thinks that it 
was the human's fault(Madonna) for causing all this trouble, but Maduin 
doesn't believe it.

Madonna then leaves and takes Terra to the gate so head for the gate, but the 
elder has already began casting the magical seal! When Maduin tries to head 
for Madonna troops and Emperor Gestahl block his path, but then the magical 
barrier starts it work and sucks out all the humans. Madonna is just ahead 
and as Maduin tries to pull back Madonna Terra is sucked out of the esper 
world and Madonna and Maduin go with her. Then Emperor Gestahl picks up Terra 
and discovers something, she's half human and half esper, Madonna wants 
Gestahl to take care of her, but Gestahl blinded by his ambitions wants to 
use Terra for greed and power purposes, Madonna tries to stop him but is 
knocked back. 

The scene shifts back to Terra and the magicite next to her is her father, 
she then realizes that she can control her power. It was also at the espense 
of an esper's life that Celes had acquired her powers. The party now heads 
back for Narche, and in the airship Setzer lets the party control the airship 
and gives you some instructions on how to use the air ship, you can also 
press start when you are on the airship to view the world map. Now heab back 
to Narche via the airship.

=============================================================================
THE RETURN TO NARCHE
Items: None
Party: Whomever
Party's level: 14-17
=============================================================================

Inside the party meets up with Banon and tells him about the way things went 
at Vector. Afterwards the party plans to combine Narche's money with Figaro's 
machinery to storm the Empire, but they are short on manpower. They think 
that if they can open the gate they can have the espers attack from the east 
and the party to attack from the North. But they must get the esper to 
understand and the only person that can do this is Terra. Terra's existence 
of half human and half esper is proof that espers and humans can exist. She 
then reluctantly agrees, then head for the airship. If you had not checked 
the clock inside the Old Man's house earlier for an ELIXIR you can do so now. 
Head for the airship and all of your party members are inside.

When you are ont he airship have Terra be in your party. Then head for the 
east side of the southern continent and to the Imperial Base. Inside the 
party notices something odd, there are no imperial soldiers at this base. 
Then continue through to the right side and across the bridge and into a 
cave. In this cave there is a treasure chest that contains an ASSASSIN knife, 
pick it up and continue on. In this next room pick up the treasure chest 
which contains a TEMPEST blade for Cyan. Then continue on, and in this next 
room you will have to make your way across, but watch for the patterns in 
here, the bridge constantly shifts around, make a mistake and prepare to be 
damaged on the magma floor below you. 

Pick up the X-POTION and the COIN TOSS relic and continue onto the next room.
Here in Basement 3, pick up an ETHER and continue your way to the other side 
of the room. When you reach the first switch hit it and a bridge leading to a 
treasure chest will open, go to that treasure chest to pick up a GENJI GLOVE. 
Then continue on, when you see two switches hit the one on the left first and 
it will open a door and inside is a TENT and a save point, so save your game 
and heal your wounds. Then go back outside and hit the other switch outside 
and a Ninja will attack you. He's a pretty tough opponent because of the 
Water Edge attack that does about 270 HP of damage to every character. 

Defeat him as normal and after the battle he will tell you that he had 
somethign buried beneath the grand stairway. Then continue on and hit the 
next switch which will open up a staircase leading to a treasure chest which 
contains an ETHER and also to the next area. Continue onto the next area, 
there's some sort of hidden passage that you must walk through when you do, 
pick up an ELIXIR and continue on. Now you will see a couple of switches, 
don't hit them just yet, go to the bottom left switch and hit that one and it 
will reveal a doorway to another room that contains a MAGICITE(remember what 
I told you? this is not an Esper!), ETHER, ATMA WEAPON, and another MAGICITE. 

Now go back outside and there are two switches above you that I told you not
to hit, avoid hitting the right switch and go around it and check the 
treasure chest, it will ask you if you want to flip a switch, do not flip the 
switch. If you hit the two switches your path to the treasure chest will be 
cut off, but it doesn't matter, you can go ahead and hit those switches 
anyways. Continue on and pick up a MAGICITE and continue onto the next room 
and make your way to the Sealed Gate. When the party reaches the Sealed Gate 
the party will have to rely on Terra to convince the espers to side with the 
returners. Then suddenly Kefka comes in, its like he knew you were coming 
here all along! The party will have to keep Kefka busy while Terra slips 
through the gate. 

After the battle Terra opens the gate and all the espers come flying out of 
the gate and temporarily stunning the party and blowing Kefka away. Then 
after the gate closes back again it becomes blocked by the collapsing rocks 
and now head back to your airship by the door below in the next room, its a 
shortcut actually. When you reach towards the end of the Imperial Base the 
other party members will meet up with you and say that the espers went off 
west towards the capital, Vector. During the trip to Vector Terra notices 
something, the espers begin to fly in berserk fashion and then the airship 
goes out of control and crash lands and now head out of the airship and walk 
towards Vector.

**********************

**NOTE: Once you rest, you cannot carry over the conversation, and if you
        rest, you lose out on a potiential three extra points.

This will be a fairly long walk towards Vector since due to the fact that 
your airship is busted. When you reach Vector the whole place is burned and 
fire is still active. Make your way to the top of this place and it appears 
that the Emperor has been expecting the party. Talk to Emperor Gestahl and it 
appears that he has lost his will to fight, the espers came here to save 
their friends but when they heard that they had been perished the espers went 
berserk and decimated the town. The power of the espers was too great than 
what Gestahl had expected and now the espers must be stopped before the whole 
world is gone. 

There are still soldiers that prefer to keep on fighting, talk to as many 
soldiers as you can to make them understand. Along the way you can pick up a 
BACK GUARD relic, X-POTION, and a REVIVIFY. Try to talk to as many soldiers 
as you can before the four minutes is up, you will have to fight sometimes to 
get your point across as well. Afterwards the Emperor and the party are at 
the banquet and Cid is now a Returner. Here you will engage in a selective 
conversation choosing who you want to toast, what to do with Kefka, etc. The 
Empire has been leveled by the espers and Gestahl has finally come to his 
senses and realize that the espers must be stopped otherwise there will be no 
world to live in. 

The Emperor will head towards Cresent Island where the espers are and he asks 
if you want to accompany him, if you choose yes General Leo will go along as 
well, if you choose no the party will make it across their own way. 
Afterwards Locke will go with Terra, but he smells a rat, the party just 
can't trust the Emperor like that. The rest of the party will stay at Vector 
to investigate things. Now head out and south towards Albrook.

=============================================================================
ALBROOK AND THE TRIP TO CRESENT ISLAND
Items: None
Party: Whomever
Party's level: 15-18
=============================================================================

When you reach Albrook head for the docks to the south part of town. Talk to 
General Leo and he will tell you that he has acquired Celes and has hired 
Shadow to help the party. Locke is surprised to see Celes and when he tries 
to talk to her, she runs away. General Leo tells the party to get some rest 
so go to the inn  and get some rest. In the middle of the night Locke heads 
out of the inn and finds Celes, he tries to talk to her but she still remains 
silent and runs off. In the morning head for the docks and talk to General 
Leo, during the middle of the voyage Terra and General Leo have a talk. 

Terra thinks its a bit funny that the Empire once manipulated her and now she 
is working with the empire, but General Leo reminds her that not everybody is 
like Kefka. General Leo knew Terra was being used as a biological weapon and 
he did nothing about it and he feels that he is no different than Kefka. 
Terra still feels she lacks of something...love. General Leo understands, but 
Terra is just young. She wants to know what love is now. Shadow then comes 
out, he decides to sleep under the stars and overhears their conversation, 
but he had no intention to. She tries to ask Shadow for help, but he tells 
her that she must look within to find her answers. Then Locke comes out, and
he has a high sense of sea sickness. Talk to General Leo and Locke, then when 
Locke leaves Celes wants to talk to him, but Locke ignores her and leaves. 
Now when you are ashore head northeast towards the town of Thamasa.

=============================================================================
THAMASA AND A SHOCKING SURPRISE
Items: Ice Rod, Echo Screen, Fire Rod, Green Cherry, Phoenix Down, Soft,
       Eyedrop
Party: Whomever
Party's level: 15-18
=============================================================================

The party finds a mother nursing her child, she says "Cure" but then sees the 
party and quickly looks for her "Cure Medecine" but the child wants her 
mother to use Cure on her, what are they talking about? Now head inside to 
the top right house and talk to the old man inside:

  "An elderly gentleman, pure of heart, and learned in the way of 
   monsters..."

Now enter his mae in as Strago and leave it at that. The party then asks him 
about espers, but he's not really familiar with the word. However he 
hesitantly denies it, but the party spots that and the music shifts as a 
young girl comes in.

  "In her pictures she captures everything: forests, water, light... the very
   essence of life..."

Now name her Relm so you can follow the walkthrough better. She then asks who 
the people are and if they can use magic as well, but Strago tells her to 
keep it down. She then sees Shadow's dog, but Shadow warns her that he bites. 
Strago tells her to go to her room, but Shadow's dog follows her. The party 
senses something a bit odd and decides to take a look around. Now take a rest 
in the inn, and the innkeeper who usually charges 1500 GP for a night's stay 
for strangers now will let you sleep in his inn for 1 GP. Then later in the 
middle of the night Strago wakes the party as Relm is trapped in the 
neighbor's house and a fire has broken out. 

He asks the party to help and Shadow is a bit slow to acknowledge. Now head 
for the house below Strago's house and a fire has gone rampant. Strago then 
casts an Ice spell, but the Mayor comes in and tells him that magic is 
forbidden, but Strago doesn't care, and the Mayor seems like he has no 
choice. The people in this town gather to try to put the flames out by magic 
but are unsuccessful in doing so. Then Strago and the party decides to go in, 
but you will have to avoid the flames. IF you do encounter a Flame a battle 
with three Ballons will start. Make your way towards the center of the house, 
along the way you can pick up an ICE ROD and a FIRE ROD. When you reach the 
center top of the house the FlameEater will attack you.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS BATTLE: FlameEater      HP: 8400
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this battle have Strago use his AquaRake, have Locke attacks as normal and 
if Terra has an Ice or Ice2 spell then use it. The FlameEater will call for 
about 4 Balloons to join the battle as well which obviously makes the battle 
a lot tougher. Keeo your HP above 100 and continue the same pattern until 
he's gone.

After the battle Interceptor finds Relm unconsious, then the flames in the 
house knock the party out, and then they begin to gang up on Interceptor, but 
Shadow comes in and takes out the flames and uses a Smoke Bomb to get the 
party out. Then they find themselves in Strago's house, who tells them that 
this is the Village of the Mage Warriors. It was long ago that humans used 
magicite to gain magical powers, and later they became known as Mage 
Warriors. It was after the War of the Magi that the espers fled to the other 
realm and left the Mage Warriors to defend for themselves. 

The humans blamed the Mage Warriors for causing the war and they were hunt 
down like animals. A few Mage Warriors escaped and found refuge here, their 
powers have weakened over time. The party needs Strago's help and he is 
willing to do so for the party saving Relm. Relm wants to come along but 
Strago won't allow her to do so. So if the espers are in the world where are 
they? Their in the mountains to the west, mainly because the mountains have 
strong magical properties. Legend has it that the espers were created there 
so the party decides to have a look. So exit out of the house and you will 
see Shadow(who left earlier) outside. Shadow wants to search for the espers 
his own way. So now that he is out of your party head west towards the 
mountains.

=============================================================================
A FATE UNDENIED
Items: X-Potion, Chocobo Suit, Tabby Suit, Heal Rod
Party: Whomever
Party's level: 16-19
=============================================================================

In the mountains head inside and pick up a HEAL ROD and head towards the top 
right of the cave, and yes that is Relm following you, but the party does not 
notice it. Then continue on and when you reach a room with three gold statues 
in the middle head for them. It appears that the three statues created magic 
as we know it and they are the source of all magic. It is said that the 
espers made these images and arranged them in a special place as the statues 
represent power beyond comprehension. It appears that the other magic flashes 
are hidden beyond human reach, most likely beyond the gate. Afterwards head 
for the left side of the room but before the party can do that they are 
attacked by Ultros and he mentions Ziegfried, wait a minute. That bozo from 
the Phantom Train? Then he will attack you as it seems that he has not 
learned his lesson yet.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS BATTLE: Ultros     HP: 22000
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This battle isn't so tough. Watch for his Tentacle attack, it will deal about 
100 HP of damage to every character when he spreads it so keep your HP above 
200 just to be safe. Attack like normal but since Ultros is an Octopus don't 
attack him with Strago's AquaRake, otherwise you will heal him. After losing 
a certain amount of HP Relm will come in(Relm's music sure is pleasant on a 
hard day's work, especially to relieve stress wouldn't you agree?). She will 
then talk to Ultros, Ultros will seem a bit angered by her as all she wants 
is just a portrait of the octapus. She then starts to get a bit down and is 
about to jump down, Terra stops her before she does and whispers something in 
Terra's ear. Terra then yells at Ultros for being such a bother to Relm, and 
Locke and Terra finally convince Ultros to tell Relm to draw Ultros a 
portrait. Ultros then casts Haste and Safe on himself, and no this is not for 
the battle but to make himself look a bit better for the portrait(!). Have 
Relm use her Sketch command and Ultros can't believe that he is no more than 
just a mere ocatpus. Then Ultros escapes.

After the battle Relm is excited that she had helped out the party so much 
and the party reluctantly lets her join. Then continue onto the next room and 
there are three switches on the floor. Now take the bottom left switch and 
then you will be dropped to the floor below. Later you will make your way 
around until you find the espers, and it appears that they are out numbered. 
Relm and Strago try to escape but are but off by the other espers. Yura then 
tells the other espers to stop and Terra confronts him, but Strago senses 
very high magical powers from Terra that it frightens him. 

Then afterwards Yura senses something in Terra and that he senses some 
familiar powers in her. The espers had set up a rule that they were not 
allowed through the gate and they had to fly through the gate to save the 
other espers that had been kidnapped. The espers had lost control of their 
powers when they had fled through the gate and leveled an entire city and 
innocent lives were lost. Locke wants the espers to come with them to talk 
peace to the Emperor in Thamasa. Later the scene shifts towards Thamasa and 
General Leo and and Yura talk things out. 

Yura apologizes for his actions, but he feels that an apology does not excuse 
them from their actions, but General Leo thinks it is the humans who have to 
apologize because they were so power hungry. Then when all is said and done, 
the party and espers laugh about it, but as does Kefka. He comes in with 
Magitek soldiers as they blast the party and General Leo's soldiers. It 
appears that Kefka is acting under the Emperor's orders to bring back the 
magicite remains to the Emperor. He then turns the espers into magicite as he 
wants the town destroy as well. After Kefka sends one of his troops to knock 
out General Leo, he awakens. Don't try to leave town though because Guardians 
will block your path and if you do lose you will have to start over again. 
Now talk to Kefka and a a fight will start.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS BATTLE: Kefka     HP: 5000
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this battle have General Leo FIGHT, he has the relic that allows him to 
use X-Fight. But if you want you can use SHOCK, which looks awesome! After
defeating Kefka he hides himself, and then Kefka calles for Emperor Gestahl. 
He apologizes to General Leo for decieving him as all he wanted was power, 
but then suddenly he changes to Kefka as it was him all along. General Leo 
was only fighting Kefka's shadow during the battle and after words Kefka 
sends General Leo a fatal wound that kills him.

After the battle a wave of energy flood the town and the scene shifts towards 
the Sealed Gate as the espers come flying through the portal as they try to 
help their fallen friends as they fly towards Thamasa. He then completely 
harnesses the power of the other espers as even another esper who challenges 
him but even he falls to Kefka's powers. Then he captures the rest of the 
espers' powers as things don't look good. Later when Kefka leaves the party 
mourns over the death of General Leo, all people seem to want is power. 

Then Interceptor comes in and is badly wounded as it appears that Shadow is 
gone as well. The party is worried about Edgar and the others and Terra wish 
she could say that they were safe, but then the other party members come by 
and meet up with the party. It appears that they've been had, the Emperor was 
a liar all along. Edgar had gotten to know a girl who had brought them tea 
who later blurted out the entire plan. The other party is shocked to hear 
that General Leo was killed as he was their finest soldier. The party then
decides to think up of a new strategy as Relm wishes to come along, but
Strago insists until Relm forcefully sways Strago's decision. The party then 
heads for the airship to discuss their plans.

=============================================================================
FLOATING CONTINENT AND FLOATING MISERY
Items: Murasame, Elixir, Beret, Atma Weapon(steal from Atma Weapon), Hardened
       knife
Party: Whomever
Party's level: 17-20
=============================================================================

On the airship it appears that the Empire is headed for the statues. The
scene then shifts towards Kefka and Emperor Gestahl and they appear to be at 
the brink of obtaining the espers. Terra senses that the world is in groaning 
pain as suddenly the land rips apart taking with it innocent lives as a giant 
continent is floated upon the world. Kefka and Gestahl are laughing about it, 
but the party seems worried. The statues were sealed away a long time ago, 
but if the statues are ever moved out of alignment even an inch the resulting 
imbalance of power would result in the entire rearrangement of the planet. 

Now head for the floating continent if you want, but if you need time to 
prepare then head down to the shops and buy some extra items. When you are 
all done head head for the floating continent but you will need to devise a 
party of 1-3, you can't have four in your party, why? You'll see soon enough. 
But before you can get on the floating continent the IAF or Imperial Air 
Force is here to stop you and you will have quite a bit of work on your 
hands. After a few battles with the Sky Armor and Spit Fire(s) you will 
eventually meet up with Ultros.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS BATTLE: Ultros & Chupon     HP: 17,000(Ultros) 10,000(Chupon)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Don't be shocked by the HP, you only have to lose them about a few thousand
hit points, after you damage Ultros enough he will call for his friend 
Chupon.(For those of you wondering Ultros and Chupon does not work for the 
Empire) This is also the first time you fight Ultros in the too hip boss
music. Keep using all of your best attacks and such and keep pounding him.
Lose Ultros about 4500 and his friend Chupon will come. After losing
Ultros about 8000 HP the second time you will finally defeat him and you
will have to lose Chupon about 10,000 to defeat him. When you defeat
Chupon he will use his Sneeze attack which will blow everyone away from 
battle.
 
After the battle the party is blown off the airship and another boss
approaches them. Note that even though you were severely wounded the last
battle you come to the next boss battle fully healed up.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS BATTLE: MissleBay & Laser Gun & Air Force & Speck    HP: 14,720(total)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This boss will be tough, watch for your HP and keep them above 280. First
take out the Laser Gun and MissleBay so you won't have to deal with them. 
Then concentrate your attacks full force on the Air Force. After destroying
the MissleBay and Laser Gun the Air Force will release a Speck which will
absorb all magic(including Ultima in which I used the Gameshark to get at
this point in the game!). Hit it with a physical attack and it should be
gone, but if you don't get rid of it quick you will have trouble damaging
the Air Force with magic. Also at this time it will begin a countdown
starting from 6, if you do not destroy both the Speck and AirForce you
will be eating the WaveCannon, a powerful attack(that has some cool special 
effects!) that does anywhere from 500-640 HP of damage to every character in 
your party! That's what makes this boss so hard! After defeating the boss you 
will acquire the CZARINA RING.

NOTE: When you encounter Gigantos, you can use the Phantom Esper to dodge
      his attacks.

You will now be on the Floating Continent, talk to Shadow and he will join 
your party and it appears that the Empire tried to kill Shadow when they had 
obtained the statues. After obtaining Shadow and saving your game head right 
and towards the bottom, the path should open up automatically, then check the 
blue orb just ahead to pick up the MURASAME blade for Cyan, then continue on 
towards the right and the path will open up for you(don't head for the stairs 
just yet) and it will lead to another blue orb and a monster will attack you, 
but its a VERY tough monster. 

Use all your best attacks and throw anything you may have at him, his Throat 
Jab attack does over 500 HP of damage so you must watch out for that. After 
the battle you will recieve a HARDENED knife. Heal your wounds also and then 
continue onto the top, it will take you to the bottom path of the floating 
Continent. Then head down and hit the switch and it will open up the right 
side for you, then continue on and go to the next transporter. Here you will 
see two other transporters so take the one on the left, it will take you to a 
switch at the bottom.

Hit that switch and the path below will pave way for you, then continue on to 
the top left and hit that switch as well and make your way down and around. 
Keep going right and you will see a switch, don't hit it just yet until you 
have picked up the blue orb and it will give you a BERET. Then head for the 
bottom transporter and it will lead to a save point, so save your game and 
heal your wounds. Then continue on back and hit the switch at the top left 
and it will open up a transporter.

Go to it and you will end up on the heart of the Floating Continent, and
you will also have the chance to head back to your airship, if you choose
to go back to your airship you will head back to your airship but you will 
have to go through the entire Floating Continent all over again. Choose no, 
unless you really have to go back for some needed supplies, and head towards 
the center and talk to the monster guarding your way and a tough fight will 
ensue.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS FIGHT: AtmaWeapon      HP: 24,000
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: Another highly useful tip from Earthq:

  "Atma Weapon (on the Floating Continent) can be defeated a LOT more easily 
  if you obtained Osmose and Rasp from Magicite Shiva.  When you wear down 
  his magic points to zero, he's done for (because remember he said he was 
  pure energy?)"

In this battle it will be very tough, use all of your best attacks and have 
Edgar use his Drill attack. You can also steal another ATMAWEAPON from this 
guy, do so if you like but you must have Locke in your party. Keep attacking 
him with your strongest attacks and keep your HP above 450, yes that's right. 
He will use Flare at some point, and most likely your party member will not 
survive that. But definitely watch for the Quake attack that does about 600 
HP of damage to every character.
 
After the battle Shadow has sold his rights to the Empire and cannot fight
with you so he leaves. Then the party approaches Kefka and Gestahl, but Celes 
also comes in as well, but it appears that the party is too late. Gestahl has 
already taken in some of the statues' power, Celes tries to convince him tos 
top but Gestahl shows the party is awesome power, and every party member but 
Celes is stunned. Gestahl wants Celes to rule the world with him, Kekfa tells 
Celes if she kills the party members her past treachery to the Empire will be 
forgotten. 

She takes the sword and thinks about the situation, would she really betray 
her friends? No, power only breeds war as she turns around and stabs Kefka. 
He really HATES Celes for doing that as he flops dead on the ground, but he 
doesn't die as he uses the power of the Statues to revive himself. But if 
Kefka tries to revive those statues it will destroy the world that they are 
trying to possess, but Kefka doesn't listen as Kefka and Gestahl enter
battle against each other. Gestahl doesn't want Kefka to do so as he tries to 
put Kefka into a deep sleep, but Kefka laughs. 

Gestahl uses Fire3 and Flare but nothing happens as Kefka is unharmed due to 
the fact that Kefka is in the field of the statues. He then commands the 
statues to attack Gestahl, it misses and sends the two flying back. After a 
few tries Gestahl is finally hit and Kefka pushes Gestahl off the Floating 
Continent down to the Earth below. Kefka then rearranges the statues, but 
Shadow then comes in and pushes the statues back into place and the rest of 
the party are now free. 

Shadow tells the party to run but he can't stop the chain reaction, but he 
guarantees the party that he will meet up with them again. You will have 6 
minutes to escape, and along the way you will have to fight against several 
Naughty(s) and a Nepura at the end of the path. Its a bit tricky picking up 
that Blue orb, try to go around without going near the blue orb and pick it 
up to recieve an ELIXIR. When you arrive at your destination you will have 
the option of JUMP or WAIT, choose WAIT and Shadow should come by and meet 
with you when your time reaches under 10 seconds. 

After the party lands on the airship the statues begin to unleash its 
incredible energy as it levels the land below. The party tries to escape the 
statues' power but the power is too great as it splits the airship in half 
and sends the party members flying across the world. Afterwards a giant and 
very impressive Napalm like explosion emits from the field as the world is 
changed forever.

A WORLD FOREVER CHANGED
Items: None
Party: Celes
Party's level: 19
=============================================================================

Here you will awaken as Cid has tended to Celes for over a year since the
statues' corruption. It appears that they have landed on a tiny deserted
island with a few strangers, but it appears that they have died of boredom
and despair. Cid doesn't even know where Locke is or if he even is alive
at all, Celes thinks that the entire party might have been wiped out as
the world continued to slide into ruin from that day one year ago. 

Cid however has not eaten in days ever since he became ill, but he doesn't
want to eat fish but its the only thing to eat here! While Cid lies down 
go look for a fish for him to eat outside, he will live longer if you catch 
him a fast fish, but since he is suppose to die anyways it really does not 
matter. Keep doing this until he starts to cough and he wants to thank you, 
after that go outside and pick up another fish and walk back inside to Cid. 

This time he does not respond, she keeps trying to get Cid to eat, but its 
too late. Celes can't even believe that Cid is gone and she decides to take a 
walk up along shore, she then finds a small letter on the floor, when the 
other people where feeling down they use to jump off the cliff up 
north...perked 'em right up! She feels alone that every one is gone, even 
Locke, the one who promised to protect her. She jumps off the cliff just to 
see her friends on the other side. Then she washes up shore in front of Cid's 
house, a bird wakes Celes back up, but she gets a bit angry that the bird 
nursed her back to health(figuratively of course) and then notices a bandana, 
could it be that Locke is still alive? Celes believes so, now head back to 
Cid's house. 

Inside you will find a letter next to Cid, check it and he will tell you that 
her friends are still waiting for her and that the stairs next to the stove 
awaits her road to freedom. So go check the staircase next to the stove to 
the left and you will find a small hidden room containing a raft, she says 
her last goodbyes and leaves off. LAter you will end up near a town, enter it 
and try to gather some information.

inside. Inside there is a HEAL ROD, PEARL ROD, HYPER WRIST, Monster-in-a-box, 
TINCTURE, MAGICITE, another Monster-in-a-box, and a DRAINER sword. Inside 
there will be some random encounters, quickly head for the boy inside the 
house first and get him out, you will be given a rather lengthy 6 minutes to 
do so. 

Afterwards the people dive for cover as the house collapses as Sabin jumps 
away. Celes is shocked to find Sabin, as she had given up hope, but now that 
she has found Sabin they may all be alive! Now they must search for the other 
party members. Now head for the northeast part of town and you will find a 
man hidden behind some trees, he's not exactly super visible, but he is 
spotable. Talk to him and he will give you a stone for 10 GP, do so and you 
will recieve the Magicite Sraphim. Afterwards head east out of town to

=============================================================================

Head towards Mobliz to the far east, its a rather long walk through a bridge 
though. Inside when you walk in two dogs will block your path and a small kid 
will come out, he will then go back in and hide. Go to the house in which he 
went inside and go downstairs and the party will finally meet up with Terra 
for the first time since the incident over a year ago. She's happy to see the 
party, but when they talk about going to stop Kefka Terra walks away. Follow 
her and talk to her, she will tell you that she can fight no longer. 

After the day the world changed Kefka directed a beam towards the town and 
all the adults of the town died while protecting their young. Terra felt that 
the children needed Terra and she can't leave them, Duane then comes in and 
tells the party that they can't take her away. Terra can't fight because she 
lost her will to fight because the kids made her feel something that she had 
never felt before. Now leave, as the party leaves a kid informs Terra that
Phunbaba is coming, Terra then goes out to confront Phunbaba as he is an
ancient demon that was released when the world came asunder.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS BATTLE: Phunbaba      HP: 28,000
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This battle Terra has no hope of winning, so just lose because all of your 
attacks will do jack.

After the battle Celes and Sabin come back, but then Phunbaba attacks them as 
well, time to teach this guy a lesson.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS BATTLE: Phunbaba      HP: 28,000
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here in this battle have Sabin perform one of his Blitz and have Celes attack 
regularly and keeping the party's HP up above 300. Keep this same pattern 
going until he escapes.

After the battle Terra is injured but otherwise fine and recovering quickly 
as she has lost her fighting edge as well as her fighting spirit. Terra 
decides to stay in Mobliz as she cannot be of any further help to the party. 
The party then leaves, but the kid stops you and thanks you for stopping 
Phunbaba and during his hastily retreat he had dropped the magicite Fenrir. 
Afterwards head northwest outside of Mobliz to find the town of Nikeah.

Party: Sabin, Celes
Party's level: 18-21
=============================================================================

When you reach the town of Nikeah head for the pub, inside talk to all of the 
thieves and he will leave. Now leave outside the pub and head to the trade 
area in the center of town and talk to the guy who looks like Edgar. Talk to 
him and he will deny that he Edgar(could it be possible that he has 
amnesia?), as he trys to avoid you keep talking to him. He calls Celes "my 
lady" and she knows Edgar would only say "my lady" and Gerad is a bit 
shocked, but he tells her that "my lady" is used all over the world. Then 
follow him towards the docks, the party will conceal themselves from Gerad's 
view as they overhear the conversation. The party then sneaks onto the ship 
as it heads towards South Figaro. 

=============================================================================
RETURN TO SOUTH FIGARO

Party: Celes, Sabin
Party's levl: 19-21
=============================================================================

In this town when you arrive head to the mansion on the north part of town 
and enter through the draft room and make your way around until the area with 
the numrous staircases and the path earlier that was blocked, you can now go 
through to basement 2 to pick up an X-POTION and an ETHER. Then head for the 
inn and talk to Gerad, he still denies the fact that he is Edgar, but why? 
Then head out and go towards west out of town to the South Figaro cave.

=============================================================================
FIGARO VIA SOUTH FIGARO CAVE
Items: Soul Sabre, Crystal Helmet, X-Potion, Ether, Gravity Rod, Regal Crown
Party: Celes, Sabin
Party's level: 19-21
=============================================================================

Inside Ziegfried will be in your way, talk to him and it appears that he will 
check inside for monsters and tells you to wait, but don't bother, just head 
inside and make your way through until you see Gerad and the theives. They 
will feed the turtle something and the little turtle will create a stepping 
stone for the theives and Gerad and Ziegfried will be right behind them. 
Follow the theives and Gerad through and you will notice that all the 
treasure chests are gone, thanks to the thieves.

In the next room Ziegfried will take the other treasure chest, follow him to 
the next area and you will now be inside Figaro castle. Continue through 
towards the engine room and make your way around and make sure you pick up 
the CRYSTAL HELM, GRAVITY ROD, X-POTION, and an ETHER. Then make your way 
through to the top left door and pick up the REGAL CROWN. Then head back and 
make your way to the center of the engine room, the party sees the thieves 
and Gerad and also the cause of the problem with Figaro castle. Gerad then 
tells the thieves to get the treasure while he takes care of the creature 
that has been a problem for Figaro Castle. Gerad finally admits to the party 
that he is Edgar, so aren't they going to give him a hand?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS BATTLE: Tentacle(4)     7,000(1), 5,000(2), 4,000(3 & 4)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This battle will be tough, have Edgar use his CrossBow, Celes her Ice magic, 
and Sabin use his AirBlade blitz, if he has it, otherwise just have him use 
pummel. They will occasionally use Sieze, and it will capture a party member, 
so any damage done to the tentacle the party member will feel a fraction of 
it, but don't let that stop you from destroyng the boss though.

After the battle Edgar tells why he did not wanted to be known as Edgar
because he wanted to use the thieves that had escaped and they lead them to 
their secret cave. Then Edgar hears the thieves coming and hides, the thieves 
leave as they thought Gerad was swallowed up by the monster and Edgar's 
intention was never to get the treasure anyways. Now go into the treasure 
room and you will see that all the treasure chests have been checked and 
emptied, but check the center statue to reveal a SOUL SABRE. Now return to 
the top floor of the engine room and the driver will lift the castle to the 
surface. Now talk to the driver again and head towards Kohlingen.

=============================================================================
RETURN TO KOHLINGEN
Items: None
Party: Edgar, Sabin, Celes
Party's level: 17-22
=============================================================================

Now head towards the town of Kohlingen which is located northwest from Figaro 
castle and head towards the pub. You will see Setzer in his chair, talk to 
him as he will be surprised that you are alive. Celes wants Edgar to come 
with them but he doesn't have it anymore, its a world too chaotic for him and 
he has lost his wings. Celes then finally convinces Setzer to come along with 
them. Setzer wants to visit Daryl's tomb as he will get the party another 
one...airship that is! The game will automatically tell you where Daryl's 
tomb is, so head for that direction.

=============================================================================
ANOTHER AIRSHIP AWAITS AND A TRAGIC PAST
Items: Exp.Egg, Man Eater, Crystal Mail, Czarina Gown, Genji Helmet
Party: Edgar, Celes, Sabin
Party's level: 17-22
=============================================================================

Here inside Setzer opens up the door under Daryl's tomb, someone which Setzer 
knew in his past. Enter in the tomb and continue through to basement 2. Now 
head for the top right door and check the tombstone to reveal a door, and hit 
the switch to let loose the water. Then head towards the bottom left door and 
pick up the CRYSTAL MAIL, continue on and pick up the CZARINA GOWN. In the 
next room hit the switch and then head back towards basement 2. Then take the 
bottom right door and pick up a GENJI HELMET, and head back to basement 2 and 
take the middle room. In this room take the turtle through to the next room 
and then hit the switch, but don't take the turtle ride yet, go to the bottom 
room and in here there are four tombstones. They read:

                     UARE            ISSQ
                  
                     ORLD            THEW

Can you guess what it is trying to say? Yes that's right "THE WORLD IS
SQUARE" Pretty catchy and inventive huh? Now head back to basement 2 and take 
the top left door and carve something in the tombstone. Carve in 
"THEWORLDISSQUARE" and it will reveal the location of the EXP.EGG relic in 
Daryl's tomb. You do not need to go through the tomb finding and tomb writing 
to actually obtain the EXP.EGG relic, you can get it without doing the 
puzzles, but its just funner this way! Now head back to the middle door in 
basement 2 and continue on through to the next save point. Here don't pick up 
any treasure chests, but do save your game and heal your wounds if any. Check 
the treasure chest to the right inside is a Presenter.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS BATTLE: Presenter     HP: 9,845     ITEM: Dragon Claw
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This boss is pretty hard, but he's like the first boss you faced at the
beginning of the game. Hit the aprt with the treasure chest and do not hit 
the shell otherwise recieve a nasty Magnitude8 quake attack. Keep your HP 
above 600, otherwise the GigaVolt will get you unless you have something that 
can obsorb lightning attacks. When he goes into his shell heal your party 
members and wait for him to pop out of his shell and then attack him. Keep 
this same pattern until he's gone.

Afterwards check the other treasure chest to the right and pick up a MAN
EATER dagger, then save your game and heal your wounds if neccessary. Now
make your way towards the next room  and check Daryl's tomb, but as the party 
does another boss attacks them.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS BATTLE: Dullahan     HP: 23,450
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This boss will be tough. He will use Level? Pearl, if your levels are not 
divisible by 2 then you should be fine. He will use Ice 3 and Pearl in this 
battle, and there isn't really much that you can do about it except bring 
that character back to life and heal them. Don't use Ice magic in this battle 
because it will heal him, use Fire magic and keep pounding away with Sabin's 
Suplex or Pummel, Setzer's Slot attack, have Celes use Runic occasionally 
because this boss uses a lot of magic and have Edgar use his Chainsaw.

After the battle the door behind the tomb will open. Continue on through and 
inside the music changes as Setzer has a retrospect of old memories. A 
flashback occurs, and an expierimental airship might prove unstable, but 
Daryl decides to go anyways and tells Setzer that if anything should happen 
to her the Falcon is his. But Setzer thinks he will win it from her in a 
race, the scene then shifts towards the flashback of Setzer's view in his
flying airship as the two race head to head. Daryl wants to be the only woman 
who came closest to the stars as Setzer will wait for her on their hill 
before sunset. Daryl never showed up, a year later after the two's race the 
wreck of the Falcon was found. 

Setzer had found the airship and restored it and place it near Daryl's tomb, 
he couldn't bare to look at it because of what it did to Daryl, but it might 
be the thing that will save not only the party, but bring a new sense of hope 
to all living in the world(notice the music change, upbeat and its time to 
put a pounding on Kefka). The airship rises out of the waters and the party 
can attack Kefka from the air, but before they can do so they will need to 
find their friends. Then a bird comes by and Celes wants Setzer to follow it, 
she doesn't know why, so Setzer does and the party lands in the town of 
Maranda.

=============================================================================
THE TOWN OF MIRANDA AND THE MYSTERIOUS MAN
Items: None
Party: Celes, Setzer, Sabin, Edgar
Party's level: 19-22
=============================================================================

In here talk to the lady to the right of the armors shop and she will show 
you some rather useful information, something you can use! Although they are 
only views of each location, there is something that you can do once your 
done obtaining your next party member. Here in this town the people describe 
a strange man who kept calling people "thou" but can it be Cyan? Then talk to 
Lola in the house to the far right of town, inside she said someone sent her 
flowers all hand made of silk from Mobliz, including a letter, but wasn't 
Molbiz demolished by Kefka's beam of light?

Then read the letter and the handwriting looks a lot like Cyan's, but where
is it coming from. Lola will ask to attach the reply to a carrier pigeon, 
so will you? Of course! Take it to the bird just outside the house to the 
left and it will show you where it is going, follow that bird to the next
destination.

=============================================================================
RETURN TO ZOZO
Items: Rust-Rid(Key Item)
Party: Edgar, Sabin, Celes, Setzer
Party's level: 19-22
=============================================================================

Here when you enter Zozo talk to the carrier pigeon and it will fly off,
follow that bird to the top of this town. But first you can't get through
since the door at the top is locked, talk to the walking merchant in this
town and he will sell you the Rust-Rid for 1000 GP to open the door, do so 
and continue through to the top of the pub and onto Mt.Zozo.

=============================================================================
JOURNEY THROUGH MT.ZOZO
Items: Ice Shield, Gold Hairpin, ed Cap, Aegis Shield, Thunder Shield
Party: Celes, Sabin, Setzer, Edgar
Party's level: 19-22
=============================================================================

Here continue to the left and pick up the ICE SHLD and RED CAP and continue 
down. Also note that there will be this bear that you will encounter in 
random battles and will steal a CHUNK of your money, defeat it quickly and 
you will win back your money, if not he will escape and your hard earned 
money will be forever gone. Then pick up the THUNDER SHLD and equip it, then 
continue towards the top and pick up the AEGIS SHLD and equip it then head 
for the door to the left and outside is a GOLD HAIRPIN relic, then go back 
inside and take the right path. 

Outside make your way through pass the rope bridge and onto the next cave and 
to the left is a save point. Save your game and heal your wounds. NOTE: You 
can hit the switch at the top right to reveal a Storm Dragon if you want, but
I must warn you that its QUITE POWERFUL, so ignore that top switch for now 
and if you do want to fight it, check my strategies in the Side Areas down 
below. Now continue through down and make your way to the room with the silk 
flowers. Read the letter Cyan is about to send to Lola and you will discover 
that her boyfriend passed away sometime ago and he begs for her forgiveness 
as he wants her to make a new start with her life. 

Now make your way to the right and Cyan will send another letter to Lola. The
party then grett themselves to Cyan as they have not seen each other for so 
long and Cyan will automatically decide to go with the party, Cyan wonders 
how the party found him and he believes that the party has been reading his 
letters and quickly goes inside the cave and removes the flowers and letter 
and claims that all of this was just a diversion of his. But we all know that 
it was no diversion scheme, he had passed through Miranda and heard about 
Lola and felt sorry for her. 

She had sent letters everyday and recieved no reply, and Cyan being the noble 
hearted man that he is decides to pretend to be her boyfriend. He saw a 
similarity between her and him, they were both looking behind, but something 
then changed. He had also bumped into Gau in Maranda, and Gau wanted to 
become stronger if he was to face Kefka and most likely he had returned to 
the Veldt. Now head back to the right side of the mountain where Cyan was and 
pick up the key to Cyan's treasure chest. Inside the treasure chest is a rare 
item, a book about machinery and a "Book of Secrets." Now head out of Mt.Zozo 
and out of Zozo and back to your airship.

=============================================================================
TERRA COME BACK!

Party: Whomever
Party's level: 20-23
=============================================================================

On your airship Cyan is in the engine room just dazzled over the machinery on 
the Falcon, talk to him if you want to change party members. Then when you 
are done head towards Mobliz and find Terra. In here Terra is not in her 
house, and it appears that Katarin ran off as Duane was a bit angry. Go to 
the house on the left side of Mobliz and watch the dog carefully. Follow that 
dog downstairs and you will see Terra, Katarin is about to have a baby and 
Duane comes in and apologizes. He hasn't been the best husband but he is 
learning and wants Katarin to come back with him. Then suddenly the whole 
place shakes as Phunbaba returns. Now you must right against Phunbaba again.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS BATTLE: Phunbaba      HP: 26,000
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This battle is the same like last time, lose him a certain amount of HP and 
he will use his BabaBreath and blow two party members away.

After the battle Terra comes and decides to help out the party as she turns 
into her esper form.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS BATTLE: Phunbaba      HP: 26,000
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This battle should be the same through and out. Have Terra use her magic and 
have the other party members attack regularly.

After the battle the kids see Terra and run back in fear, but the little girl 
notices that she is Terra. The children are not afraid of Terra anymore and 
she understands what she has been burying for so long..."love." She realizes 
that she must fight for the future of the children, she gives her goodbyes to 
Katarin and Duane and to the children, and Terra has discovered a new part of 
her she never understood until now and she will fight for the people who have 
not even been born yet. Now head back to your airship and rearrange your new 
party and head towards the Veldt which is north of Mobliz.

=============================================================================

have three members in your party, if you have four then Gau won't come to 
you. When you go into a random encounter win the battle and Gau will come at

Items: Striker, Rage-Ring
Party: Whomever
Party's level: 20-23
=============================================================================

In here when you enter Interceptor will see you and it appears that he wants 
you to follow him. So follow him and in this next room there are thieves near 
a fire, talk to them and they will tell you SPECIFICALLY how to acquire Gau 
if you had not done so yet, so if you can't interpret their words and still 
don't understand you are pretty slow! Continue through and pick up the 
treasure chest to the left and inside it contains a RAGE RING relic. There is 
also another treasure chest which contains TIGER FANGS for Sabin, but its 
guarded by an Allo Ver. 

After that make your way through to the bottom staircase. And continue to go 
through the stairs until you reach a door with a switch to the right of it. 
Hit the switch and pick up the STRIKER and then continue through to the right 
and you should eventually reach a save point, so save your game and heal your 
wounds. Then make your way to the next room you will see Shadow(or Relm if 
Shadow did not jump off with you on the Floating Continent). Then suddenly 
the party is attacked!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS BATTLE: SirBehemoth(2)      HP: 19,000    
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This battle will be difficult, cause you will have to face off against the 
two of them. Have Terra and Celes use Fire magic on the first SirBehemoth and 
have Cyan use his SwdTech, Sabin his Blitz(pummel or Suplex), Gau anyone of 
his rage attacks, Setzer his regular attacks or Slots, and have Edgar use his 
Drill in this battle. Keep doing this until the first one dies and then 
another one will attack from behind. This time continue the same pattern but 
have Celes and Terra use Ice magic against the 2nd SirBehemoth. After 
defeating the two you will recieve a BEHEMOTHSUIT and CRUSTAL SHLD.

After the battle the party takes Shadow(or Relm) to Thamasa where he can heal 
his wounds. Then a flashback occurs to Shadow's past where he left out of 
town and Interceptor follows. 

NOTE: If you saved Relm a different scenario will take place obviously.
      Now leave towards Jidoor which is south of Zozo on the western part of
      the world map.

=============================================================================
OWZER
Items: Moogle Suit, Relic Ring, 2000GP, Potion, Ether, Remedy
Party: Whomever
Party's level: 21-24
=============================================================================

Here head straight for the mansion up top to Owzer's house. Inside here head 
straight up and turn on the lights. Then head to the left and you will notice 
that the paintings are different from last time. Now check the bottom left 
portrait of the lady and two Dahlings will attack you, defeat them and a door 
will replace their portrait. Enter through to the next room and head 
downstairs, here in this room a portrait will attack you and you will have to 
fight off against a SoulDancr and four Wild Cat(s). 

After defeating them head to the left door up top to pick up a MOOGLE SUIT 
and then head for the right door. Here head straight up and go behind the
three doors to pick up a RELIC RING. Here the three doors will open and close 
and only one of them will open at a time. Ignore the two doors on the right 
and head for the left door and continue on through to the room with the 
floating treasure chests. Try to reach for them and a battle will ensue. 

The treasure chest include 2000 GP which is guarded by a Soul Dancr and four 
Wild Cats, a POTION which is also guarded by a Soul Dancr and four Wild Cats, 
an ETHER which is also guarded again by a Soul Dancr and four Wild Cats, and 
finally a REMEDY which is once again gaurded by a Soul Dancr and four Wild 
Cats. After picking those treasure chests up check the middle painting a a 
fight against a StillLife will ensue, defeat it and a door will replace the 
portrait, and enter through to the next room.

In this next room there are two doors and a save point, save your game and
heal your wounds. Now enter the door on the right and talk to Owzer, he tells 
you that there is a monster inside the painting and that the party cannot 
attack the painting because it means too much to Owzer, then Relm is startled 
by the presence of Chadarnook who came out of the painting.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS BATTLE: Chadarnook     HP: 30,000(each)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This boss is extremely tough. He will use Phantasm on the party which is 
sorta like a poison attack that constantly drains your HP. Lose him a few HP 
and he will change form and this form will use Bolt 2 and Bolt 3. So if you 
have a THUNDER SHLD or AEGIS SHLD equipped that shouldn't be much of a 
problem. Have Cyan use his SwdTech, have Sabin use his Suplex or Pummel, have 
Edgar use his Drill, have Setzer use his Slot attack, have Gau use anyone of 
his Rage attacks, and have Terra and Celes use magic or attack as normal.

After the battle Relm tells the party to relax and Owzer thanks the party for 
saving the painting in which he thinks is more precious than his own life. 
The monster was in the portrait because Owzer had bought a stone from the 
auction house and he suddenly felt like painting a picture of a Starlet, but 
he could never paint it since it was out of his league, but then he found 
Relm, whose artistic abilities surpassed those of anybody Owzer has ever seen 
in his life. 

He then tells you that the stone is over by the bookshelf, so check the 
bookshelf and you will recieve the Magicite Starlet in which Owzer is more 
than happy to get rid of. Relm then decides to leave and she tells Owzer that 
she will be back to finish the painting. Now head back to your airship and 
head towards the giant star shaped mountain in the middle of the world map, 
a top the southern continent.

=============================================================================
THE CAVE TO THE LOST TREASURE
Items: Wing Edge, Ribbon, Draon Horn, Warp Stone
Party: Whomever
Party's level: 22-25
=============================================================================

You should see a small spot in which you can land your airship, when you land 
or at least try to, Setzer will tell you that you will need to split up into 
two groups. So do so, and afterwards you will land atop the Pheonix Cave, you 
can switch between the two groups using the Square button or the "Y" button 
if you are playing the SNES version.

NOTE: This place is very complicated and I will try to be as detailed as
      possible, but most likely you will be better off doing this yourself
      instead of following this guide. But for those who are really stuck
      read along as I will tell you EVERYTHING that is in this cave.

Now enter inside and have the first group step on the switch and switch to
group 2 to have them go through the door on the left. After group 2 has gone 
through have them step on the switch that is above the switch group 1 is on. 
Switch to group 1 and have them take the right path and hit the switch above 
to remove the spikes. Now switch to group 2 and move through the path that 
has been removed of spikes(don't take the treasure chest to the left yet 
otherwise you will fall to the bottom spikes below) and walk to the right and 
down the stairs to the switch, step on the switch and the spikes on the floor 
will be removed, now switch to group 1. 

Now walk through and to the next room, the treasure chest to the right 
doesn't contain anything. Now walk up top and the treasure chest contains 
nothing so don't bother with it and hit the switch which will reveal three 
stepping stones over the magma. Now switch to group 2, and take the top left 
staircase. Here in the Magma room go down and take the staircase up to the 
next room and hit the switch that will create a bridge leading to the WING 
EDGE, the bridge is here so that you do not fall to the spikes below. Then go
back to the next room and take the stepping stone path, don't get the
treasure chest just yet and hit the switch that you see. 

Now switch to group 1 and have them take the path that was opened and go to 
the switch that you saw above the rock and step on the switch and the rock 
will move out of the way for group 2. Now switch to group 2 and head towards 
the next room. In this room there is a save point to the left, so save your 
game and heal your wounds. Now step on the switch above and switch to group 
1. Now walk around the path and onto the next room. Here you will have to use 
the stepping stones to make your way across around to the next room, and yes
there are still no treasures in the treasure chests. 

Here in this room hit the switch and the water will drop below and cool off 
the magma, now switch back to group 2, now have this group hit the switch to 
the left which will clear the rocks for group 1, now switch to group 1. Now 
continue down and you will see a dragon wandering around, ignore it and pick 
up the DRAGON HORN relic and its optional if you want to fight the dragon. 
But if you do refer to my Side Areas section on how to beat him. Whether you
choose to or not, do up the stairs and stand on the switch that reveals two 
rocks. Now switch back to group 2 and have them walk to the left side and to 
the magma room that had been cooled off. 

In this room you can pick up your first treasure chest which is a RIBBON and 
then continue onto the top left room and walk across the two rocks and now 
you should be with the other group. Hit either switch at the bottom and 
switch to group 1 and have them hit the other switch. Now continue through to 
the bottom and in the next room the party will meet up with Locke. Locke has 
discovered a legendary relic that can restore life, it has been weakened over 
time due to the large cracks in the stone. 

Locke feels that his life has no purpose ever since that incident with 
Rachel, but he wants to right the wrong that he had made. Locke decides to go 
with the party, but only as far as Kohlingen, he then sets the stone near 
Rachel, but nothing happens. But after a rather unuseful remark by the 
Patriarch and stone begins to glow and Rachel awakens as she has been 
dreaming of Locke as she wanted to hear Locke's voice. However the Pheonix 
has only given Rachel very little time and she must leave soon, but she wants 
to tell Locke something. 

The times she spent with Locke she was happy and at the moment the incident
occured she only thought of Locke and will never forget Locke and the joy 
that he has brought her. As Rachel is about to leave she tells Locke that he 
must forget about the past and stay true to himself as Rachel gives the power 
of the Pheonix to Locke. She then leaves Locke and the power of the Pheonix 
now inscribes along Locke. When locke leaves to the room above Celes is with 
him, but Locke has a new sense of hope and now its time to stop Kefka once 
and for all. 

As Locke and Celes leaves, Locke remembers something. He hands over the the 
treasures that he had found in the Pheonix Cave(that explains why all those 
treasure chests were empty), X-POTION, FENIXDOWN, X-ETHER, ELIXIR, FLAME 
SHLD, and a VALIANTKNIFE. The party has an appointment with Kefka, but don't 
head to the tower yet. Head towards Thamasa where you had left Shadow, its on 
a small island at the bottom right corner of the world map.

=============================================================================
WHERE'S SHADOW?
Items: None
Party: Whomever
Party's level: 24-28
=============================================================================

In Thamasa Shadow is gone(or Relm) and people in town say he is headed for 
the Colleseum, or has already done so. So head to the Colleseum.

NOTE: If you did not save Shadow head towards Jidoor, use the Owzer
      walkthrough to get you to Relm.

=============================================================================
SHADOW WAIT UP!
Items: None
Party: Whomever
Party's level: 24-28
=============================================================================

The Colleseum is in the northwest part of the world map at the very tip. It 
looks a bit like the Opera house on the outside so don't be fooled by it. 
Inside you will see a familiar face, wait a minute...is that Ultros? Ha! 
Let's take this minute to laugh at him! You also learn here that you can bet 
items for prizes, in fact there are a lot of different combinations here, and 
I do mean A LOT! But for now head towards the Colleseum's battle arena and 
bet the STRIKER daggar(hopefully you did not sell it!) and a battle against 
Shadow will start. This battle should be pretty easy since Shadow has no 
armor or weapons to defeat you with. After the battle Shadow tells the party 
that the only thing he knew how to do was fight. He then decides to go with 
the party, so now head back to your airship and head for the magic tower.

=============================================================================
STRAGO WAKE UP YOU BONEHEAD!
Items: None(yet)
Party: Relm and whomever
Party's level: 24-28
=============================================================================

The Magic Tower is on the same island as Mobliz is, its west of Mobliz and 
its comepltely surrounded by high terrain and mountains and the only way 
through is buy airship. Land your airship near it and make sure you have Relm 
in your group. Inside Relm will immediately yell at Strago and then he 
awakens from his brainwash and is surprised to see alive. Of course Relm is 
alive "you idiot!" Did you think she would check out before the old man? 
Afterwards Strago makes himself at home on the airship, so now that everybody 
is back its time to lay the "SmackDown" on Kefka. Don't bother with this 
place yet, its VERY tough to get through even the first few floors at your 
state now, but for now head towards Kefka's tower via the airship.

=============================================================================
THE FINAL BATTLE AWAITS
Items: Rainbow Brush, Megalixir, Minerva, Tack Star, Force Armor, Ribbon,
       Fixed Dice, Red Cap, Nutkin Suit, Guantlet, Hero Ring, Aegis Shield,
Party: Whomever(split into three groups)
Party's level: 26-30
=============================================================================

NOTE: Before you head inside here I suggest you check out my Side Areas 
      section first. The side areas will significantly boost your levels and
      gain you some incredible weapons and armors and magicite. However, it
      is still very possible to beat the game without all the extras.

The battles that you are about to fight will drain you of your HP and MP 
rather quickly and you will need to stock up on materials like TENTs, 
POTIONs, and stuff like that before you go. Kefka's Tower is on the southern 
continent north of the town of Albrook. You can't enter it from the bottom, 
you must move in through with the airship. Land your airship on top of 
Kefka's tower, but Celes doesn't feel right about something. If they destroy 
the statues the very power that gives the espers life will kill the espers, 
and what will happen to Terra? 

You will now have to break your entire party into three groups. Split your 
party into any three groups that you want. Here you will start off with group 
1, you will need to switch between groups, but don't worry, you don't need to 
do it as intensively as the Pheonix Cave. From here go around and pick up the 
CORONET and then enter the next area. In here take the escalator down to the 
next area. In here pick up the FIXED DICE at the top and onto the next area 
outside and then continue onto the next area. 

In this room you will have to wait here. Go to your second party now. From 
here go around and down and over at the top left of this room pick up the 
MINERVA and go down to the bottom right and take the top room and inside pick 
up the TACK STAR and then continue on outside. Here in this room there is a 
monster to the far left, approach it and a fight will enuse.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS BATTLE: Atma    HP: 55,000
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This boss is one tough customer. Watch for his Southern Cross attack, his 
Fire 3 attack, Bolt 3 attack, and his Clean Sweep attack. His physical  
attacks deal a good amount of damage at your point in levels right now but if 
you set up Golem you won't be harmed by his physical attacks. Have everybody 
use there best attacks or best magics like Ultima(if you have it) or Flare or 
Pearl or Ice 3 and so on. Keep your HP above 1300 if possible to survive his 
Meteor attack. NOTE: Mog can learn a new dance in this battle.

After the battle there will be a save point that will open up, so save your
game and heal your wounds. Then continue onto the next area make your way
around to the left and enter the next room. Here there are two pipes, ignore
the right pipe and enter the left pipe. Outside here make sure you pick up
the FORCE SHLD and then go down and enter the door on the left. Inside here
there is a RIBBON and you will also see group 1, step on the switch and the 
floor will make passage for group 1. Now go back and through the door to the 
right and keep going and you will see a dragon on top of the red platform, 
you can fight it if you want if you feel strong enough, but you can ignore 
him for now.

Then continue onto the room to the left and make your way to the next switch. 
You can step on it if you want, but for now switch to your third group. Now 
in group 3 keep going down and along the way pick up the RED CAP and enter 
the top room. In here keep going up and continue along the way and pick up a 
NUTKIN SUIT and a GUANTLET. Now go back outside and take the bottom room. 
Keep going and pick up a HERO RING relic along the way and move towards the 
top moving rail and in here there is a save point at the top left. So save 
your game and heal your wounds and continue on to the left. Before you can go 
anywhere a monster attacks you.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS BATTLE: Inferno & Striker & Rough     HP: 30,800(I) 8,000(R) 11,000(S)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This battle will be tough. It will most likely start the battle with the
Atomic Ray attack, which causes at max 1100 HP of damage to every character.
Keep your HP up and take out the Striker and Rough(its arms) first so that 
you don't have to deal with its Bolt attacks. Use all of your best attacks 
and keep pounding on him while keeping your HP up. Watch for his GigaVolt 
attack which can inflict over 2000 HP of damage.

After the battle continue on outside and out here pick up the MEGALIXIR and 
to the left pick up the RAINBOW BRSH and also hit the shining treasure chest 
to clear up the path to the left of you and then continue on. You will then 
see another dragon, fight it if you wish and if you do and need help refer to 
my guide below with the 8 Dragons. Whether you do or not continue onto the 
next area and step on the switch and the door will open up. Now switch back 
to your first group. Now in here continue onto the next area and make sure 
you pick up another TACK STAR along the way and then you will see your other 
two party members. 

Go up and step on the switch and go to either side, when you do the path will 
be blocked, but for now go to either side and drop the weight on the switch, 
but your party members must move out of the way first. After doing that 
switch to your other party and go up the now accessible stairs and do the 
same thing your first group did and drop the weight on the switch. Now switch 
to your other group and have them reach up the middle switch and stay there. 
Now have your other two party members hit the other switches, then when all
three groups are standing on the switches the door will open up. Now have 
your middle group go down and hit the switch again. This will open up the 
doors on the other two sides. Now continue up and go on to the middle room 
and a Guardian will be in your path.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS BATTLE: Guardian     HP: 60,000
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
At first when you encountered this guy you could not damage him and he would 
always beat you, but now you can damage him. You can damage him now but this 
guy is TOUGH. Heck he's the toughest boss in the game as of now. Use all of 
your most powerful attacks and magics and keep your HP up at max if possible 
and keep pouding away. Watch for its Entwine attack, it will cause slow, so 
use either Dispel or Fast to cure it.

After the battle a save point will open up, so save your game and heal your 
wounds and continue on. Keep going and then you will have to fight against 
another boss.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS BATTLE: Poltrgeist     HP: 58,000     ITEM: Aura Lance
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This battle will be tough. Watch for it to use Meteo which will cause over 
2000 HP of damage to every character. Its Fire 3 attack and Southern Cross 
attack can be absorbed by a FLAME SHLD. USe your best magic and keep your HP 
up at max if possible and attack attack attack!

After the battle the continue on and in here is another save point. So save 
your game and continue on and in here step on the switch and switch to your 
other group. Here just continue on until you reach the next statue.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS BATTLE: Doom          HP: 63,000     ITEM: SKY RENDER
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This battle will be very tough. Watch for its N.Cross attack, it will freeze 
your party members, but not all. Use low level fire magic attacks against 
your party members to defrost them. Watch for its Ice 3 attack as well, so if 
you have an ICE SHLD equipped you can absorb the attack or nullify it with 
your FLAME SHLD. Watch for it when it targets a party member, its preparing 
to use its Demon Rage attack, it will do at max 7500 HP of damage. However 
this can be nullified to just 1500 HP of damage if a party member is in the 
back row and having the Safe casted as well as wearing Force armor equipment 
with the Paladin Shld. 

After the battle a save point will appear, so save your game and heal your
wounds and continue onto the next room and step on the switch. Now switch to 
your next group.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS BATTLE: Goddess       HP: 44,000     ITEM: Excalibur
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This battle will not be easy, even though you get the Pincer attack off in 
this battle. Watch for its Southern Cross, it will do a good deal of damage 
to your party members, so keep your HP up and above 700 just to be safe. Use 
your best magics and attack constantly while keeping a close eye on your HP 
and the battle should be won.

After the battle a save point will open up, so save your game and heal your 
wounds and continue onto the next room and step on the switch and you will be 
transported over to Kefka's domain at the top of this tower. Here when you 
enter Kefka has been expecting you, he appears in a magical triangle and uses 
his power and toys around with the party. But Terra tells him that people 
will keep rebuilding the things he takes from them, but Kefka doesn't care, 
he will destroy everything people build, he doesn't understand why people 
cling onto their lives when they know they won't live forever, but Terra 
tells him that its the day-to-day concerns, personal victories, the 
celebration of life and love. 

Kefka however doesn't like what he is hearing and asks if Terra has found her 
joy, and she has, she knows what love is. Locke has learned a great deal 
about life as well, Edgar's dream is to build a kingdom of freedom and 
dignity, Sabin has come and expierienced the caring that his brother has 
brought for him throughout his childhood, Celes has met someone who can 
accept her for who she is, Strago has a special little granddaughter, Relm 
has a brave grandpa that will stand with her at all times, Setzer's airship 
and Daryl's love, Mog has friends here as well(that what he would say if you 
have him in your party), Gau has friends that are by him right now. Kefka 
doesn't like what the party is telling him, it sickens him as they "sound 
like chapters from a self-help booklet!" 

Then Kefka uses his power and sends the beam of light towards the the world, 
he wants to destroy everything and create a monument of non-existence(does 
this sound a bit Exdeath-ish?), but Terra tells him that life will go on and 
that people will always have dreams. But Kefka will hunt them down, Locke 
will not allow him to harm another living thing, then Kefka sends another 
beam of light towards the world. 

Now you will have to set up an order in which the party members will fight in 
1-12, but if you have been following the walkthrough then there are only 11 
members in your party. You will face off in four battles each are very tough, 
if one of your characters die during battle, the next character up will 
replace that character until all of your party members lose or if you win all 
four battles. After you're done a battle will ensue:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FINAL BATTLE 1: (Kefka Demon) & (Demon's hands)   HP: 30,000(KD) 60,000(BH)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here in this battle have Cyan use his SwdTech, have Sabin use his Pummel, 
have Terra use her regular attacks or magic and the same goes for Celes, have 
Gau use any one of his rage attacks, have Setzer use his Slot attack (its 
better if you use the Coin Toss relic and use GP Rain instead), have Edgar 
use his CrossBow, have Locke attack as normal, have Strago use his AquaRake 
attack or attack with magic, and have Relm attack as normal and use magic. 
Once you knock out the hands have Edgar use his Drill against the Kefka 
demon. He will use R.Polarity at the beginning of the match and that will 
draw you closer to him and make his physical attacks cause more damage, there 
is nothing that you can do about this besides casting Safe on the party or 
hope that he will miss with its attacks because they are VERY powerful.

After this battle another tough battle will ensue.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FINAL BATTLE 2: (Outergate Demon)     HP: 112,000(combined)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this next battle its the same as the last one, this time you will have to 
deal with four targets instead of three and you will be back in your previous 
positions as the R.Polarity effect has worn off from your last battle. Keep 
your HP at max if possible and you might want to use Haste to quicken your 
party and make quick decisions otherwise you can find yourself having an 
early deathwish. If you knock out one of the targets it will use the last 
attack 10 Hits, the attacks are pretty powerful considering at what levels 
you are at right now, so you may want to switch your party members to the 
back ranks prior to destroying any one of the targets.

After this battle the next battle will ensue.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FINAL BATTLE 3: (Unearthly Standstill)     HP: 9,999(Girl) 40,000(sleep)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This battle is the EASIEST of the three battles so far. However you must heal 
immediately after it uses the White Wind attack at the beginning of the 
battle because as you can expect it will put your HP at near fatal condition. 
Attack normally like the battles above and keep your HP up above 1000, or to 
its max because the Meteo attack(yes that's right, not Meteor) will cause a 
great deal of damage against the party. Make your decisions quick and keep 
your rythmn going and you should win this battle. Also note that there are 
only two targets, one of the targets(I forgot which one specifically) is 
easily taken out with a few hits. Also even though you destroy this boss, it 
will use Calmness as its final attack and take out one party member.

After the battle the music from the beginning of the game(you know before you 
even begin playing the part with Vicks and Wedge) and this is your last 
battle.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FINAL CONFRONTATION: Kefka       HP: 62,000
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kefka doesn't even know where hope and dreams come from, these things he
believes that he is going to destroy and then gives his menacing laugh. This 
battle will be tough. The methods for beating him are the same as like the 
previous battles, but keeping your HP up to the max is a definite must. (the 
music in here starts to get I don't know a bit Lavos-ish wouldn't you 
agree?)He will use the Fallen One attack that reduces your entire party's HP 
to 1, so immediately heal. I would also like to note that his Goner attack 
does massive damage, but that's not the impressive thing about it, I'm 
talking about the special effects!

                                   ------
                                   Ending
                                   ------

  NOTE: This is a spoiler, and as you can tell from my FF7 FAQ and FF2 FAQ
        I do this all the time. So if you do not want to know the ending of
        the game then turn away now!...What did I just tell you? Go... Your
        still reading this huh?...Whoever is reading this is a bamma...heh,
        I guess that means you!

After the battle with Kefka the whole place is about to collapse. Then (put 
party member who was on airship) comes in and tells the party that the 
airship is just ahead(note that since you only have 11 party members you will 
just escape without anyone coming in, but if you came here with 10 party 
members then that party meber will alert you to escape, same thing if you 
have 14 party members). Terra then transforms into her esper state and 
collapses, then the magicite the party was carrying diperses off into the 
air. Magic is starting to die from the world and the magicites can't even 
exist, but does this mean that Terra will die out to? 

I mean she is half human. Terra then gets up and will lead the party out with 
her last ounce of strength. A picture of a book is shown in superior 
graphical quality that looks almost lifelike and Cyan is seen escaping while 
pushing out the mechanical legions that block the way for Edgar. Then Setzer
bumps into a wall that opens up the paths on both sides, then the door on the 
left explodes and they party goes the other way, sometimes you just have to 
feel your way through each situation. Sabin holds up a giant piece of metal 
that nearly kills his brother, but he knew that Edgar be the better king and 
he didn't even know why he had the stupid muscles.

Mog then suddenly almost falls hanging on to dear life as the floor collapse 
as Edgar pick up Mog by the hair, in which Mog hates. Umaro then busts a way 
open for Setzer and Celes as the door in front of them is blocked and cheers 
afterwards. Gogo however has to mimic Celes as Setzer and Edgar are blocked 
off, he does the exact same thing Celes does as they move on. Gau on the 
other hand shows Edgar and Celes a shortcut to the bottom path below as he 
tosses them down, pretty funny if you ask me! Locke, Celes, Terra, and Setzer 
and Edgar escaped but Celes nearly falls on her way, but Locke saves her and 
promises that he will not let go. 

Terra on her way out has the last piece of magicite disappear as her father 
Maduin tells her that if her human side is strong enough she will be able to 
live on as a human being on the world. Relm saves Strago as he is too old to 
catch up, but luckily Relm is strong enough to carry him! Shadow then tells 
Interceptor to go as he runs off and decides that he will start over again. 
Strago however tries to reach for the pulley, but after a couple of tries Old 
Man can jump! Then the game thanks you, and so do I for respecting this FAQ 
hopefully.

The party must hurry out, as Terra shows them the way as the last piece of
magicite turns to dust and Terra's power is fading. The scene shifts towards 
the kids from Mobliz and Katarin can be seen having a baby. The party on the 
other hand is knocked out but slowly get up, and Terra has fallen aboard 
thanks to Setzer. Now the credits roll up as the airship strolls through 
beautiful environments showing off the graphical Mode 7 power of the SNES(in 
my opinion they beat anything to date!). The crystal theme from FFIV comes up 
and Katarin's baby has just arrived in a new world of dreams and hope. 

The kids in Mobliz walk out and greet Terra, the scene shifts towards Thamasa 
as the burned house is being rebuilt. In another town a plant is growing and 
in Figaro Castle the pople are moving around in activity, Terra then stands 
at port bow and lets her air fly through the wind as the doves that fly by 
move towards the land as new life is being brought upon the land and a quick 
shot and almost life-like shot of the Falcon is seen flying off.

Afterwards the FMV ending plays. You will also be asked if you want to create 
a system file prior to the FMV ending, doing so means all of the Bonus 
sections you have unlocked will be saved to a memory card.

  Well as you can expect since FF5 had so MANY side areas FF6 would have a

  beaten the game, and I'm here to help you complete all of them!

THE 8 DRAGONS AND CRUSADER
Items: None
Party: Whomever
Recommended level: 32
=============================================================================

Remember when you were in Mt.Zozo and I told you not to fight that Wind 
Dragon? Well if you listened and haven't done so head back to the place and
hit the switch to reveal the Wind Dragon and make sure you have some strong
magic and also that you have a THUNDER SHLD equipped. Then go near the Dragon 
and a fight will ensue.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
DRAGON BATTLE: Storm Dragon     HP: 42,000     ITEM: Force Armor
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This battle here will be very tough, but if you can defeat the MagiMaster you 
can win this battle as well. Keep your HP above 800 and pound it with your 
regular attacks. Use Ultima if you have it or Meteor, Flare, or Pearl. Have 
Sabin use his Bum Rush(or any other of his Blitz attacks) and have Cyan use 
his level 7 SwdTech to deal monster damage, have Edgar use his Drill(if you 
are at level 80 this can deal over 8000 HP of damage with every hit!) and 
have Gau use one of his rages. Have Gogo mimic a strong attack(E.G. Ultima, 
Drill, etc.), have Mog use his best Dance, have Strago use his GrandTrain 
Lore attack, and have Relm attack with magic. Anybody equipped with the 
THUNDER SHLD will take no damage from his Wind Slash attack and you will 
absorb any of his lightning attacks.

After the battle there are now 7 dragons left. Did you remember when you were 
in the Pheonix Cave there was a dragon walking around? In case you did not 
choose to fight it, head back once you are strong enough and go near it and a 
fight will ensue.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
DRAGON BATTLE: Red Dragon      HP: 30,000     ITEM: Strato
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This battle here will be very tough just like the first battle. He will use a 
lot of Fire magic as you can expect and also as you can expect hit him with 
Ice magic to deal heavy damage. If you are wearing an armor that protects 
against Fire or absorbs fire that should do you well. He will use Fire 2 and 
Fire 3 at times and his regular attacks will do mild damage, not much that 
will get you concerned over anything. Use Ultima, Meteo, Flare, Pearl, or Ice 
3 to damage him. Contiue this pattern and keep your HP above 1000, so that 
his Fire 3 attack won't get you.

After the battle there are now 6 dragons left. Head towards Narche and along 
the northern mines there is a dragon wandering around, just walk near it and 
a fight will ensue.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
DRAGON BATTLE: Ice Dragon      HP: 24,400     ITEM: Force Shield
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here in this battle hit it with everything you've got. Fire magic works real 
well in this battle as you can expect and use Ultima, Meteo, Flare, or Pearl 
to damage it if you don't have a Fire 3 magic. He will use his Absolute 0 
attack, so watch for it and keep your HP above 500. Also when your party 
members are frozen use fire magic on them to free them, if he gets your 
entire party with it, there is literally nothing you can do about it. Keep 
hacking away and he should be gone.

After the battle there are now 5 dragons left. Now head for the Magic Tower 
in which you acquired Strago in and at the third part of the tower there is a 
room in which you got the STUNNER in, a dragon is in that room go to it and a 
fight will ensue.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
DRAGON BATTLE: White Dragon      HP: 18,500      ITEM: Pearl Lance
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This battle will be pretty tough. Don't use Pearl in this battle because it 
will absorb it, so use Ultima, Meteo, or Flare. Keep your HP above 1200 and 
keep pounding him with your magic attacks like Fire 3 or Ice 3. He will start 
the battle off with two consecutive Pearl attacks and they will do about 1100 
HP of damage. Keep using Ultima in this battle and he will counter with 
Dispel, if you cna keep a constant chain of Ultima spells he will seldom pull 
off his Pearl attack! 

After the battle you will recieve the PEARL LANCE. Now there are just four 
dragons left. Now go to Figaro Castle and ask the driver to go to Figaro and 
he will say that something is odd about the stratum. Refer to the Odin's 
reign section of the Side Area to tell you exactly where the next dragon is.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
DRAGON BATTLE: Water Dragon      HP: 26,900
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here in this battle your lighting attacks will do well against him. Have
Sabin use his Aurabolt, and have any other of the characters use lightning
based attacks or their best and most damaging attacks. Keep your HP above
500 otherwise its Clean Sweep attack will get you. Keep this process up until 
you've won. NOTE: If Clean Sweep is used on Strago here in this battle he 
will learn it. Its a more powerful version of AquaRake.

Now there are 3 dragons left. Head for the Opera House on the southwestern
part of the world map to face off against your next dragon. In here talk to 
the Impressario and he will tell you that a dragon is sitting smack in the 
middle of the stage. Head for the switch room at the top right and hit the 
second switch from the right and you will fall to the floor below and a fight 
will ensue.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
DRAGON BATTLE: Dirt Dragon      HP: 28,500     ITEM: Magus Rod
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This battle will be tough. Cast Float(you should do this before battle) to 
every party member in here so you can avoid his Quake and Magnitude8 attack. 
If you don't you will suffer at least 1800 HP of damage from his Quake attack 
and about 1100 from his Magnitude8 attack. After you are on Float status all 
you have to worry about are his physical attacks which do only about 400 HP 
of damage, and his Slide attack which does about 700 HP of damage to every 
party member. So keep your HP up and keep attacking him with your strongest 
attacks like Ultima, Flare, Pearl you know the real deal. Keep this up and 
you should win the battle.

After the battle it looks like the Impressario will have to save the world
again. There are now only two dragons left. So where are they? The two last
dragons are on Kefka's Tower silly! The second group in Kefka's Tower will
fight the Gold Dragon.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
DRAGON BATTLE: Gold Dragon      HP: 32,400      ITEM: Crystal Orb
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes I know, it doesn't look like a dragon to me. It looks more like a 
dinosaur, but who cares. This battle will be tough, it uses only lightning 
attacks like GigaVolt, Bolt 3, Bolt 2, and Bolt. Its Bolt attacks do a lot
of damage, but having the Thunder Shld equipped in this battle will make the 
battle go by like a breeze. Hit him with your most powerful magics and keep 
your HP up at all times and hopefully he will be gone.

After the battle there is only 1 dragon left. The third group will face off 
against the last dragon.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
DRAGON BATTLE: SKULL DRAGON     HP: 32,800     ITEM: Muscle Belt
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This battle will be pretty tough. Since this dragon is undead it has a 
weakness against fire. Use your most powerful fire spells and other magic 
spells. Watch for its Disaster attack, it will make a party member be 
infected with every negative status effect in the book, but having either the 
RIBBON or PALADIN SHLD equipped will counteract those effects. Keep your HP 
and attack fast otherwise you will be knocked out with its Condemned attack.

That's it! You now have Crusader, a very power Esper and you can learn
Merton, a really powerful spell that's on par with Ultima! Congratulations!

=============================================================================
ACQUIRING GOGO
Items: Hero Ring, Thunder Shield, Zyphyr Cape, Tack Star, Ether, Magical
       Brush, Red Jacket, Genji Armor, Fake Mustache
Party: Whomever
Recommended level: 30
=============================================================================

Take your airship to the small island on the top right corner of the world
and walk into a random encounter and you should meet up with a ZoneEater and 
let it Engulf the entire party. After it Engulfs the entire party you will be 
under the island. In here don't go up, its the exit out of here and since you 
didn't do anything here then why would you want to leave? Take the stairs 
down and in this area walk towards the left and jump your way across. Watch 
for the walking green men though, don't try to talk to them because all they 
will do is push you to the floor below and you will have to make your way 
back up. 

Along the way pick up the GENJI ARMOR, MAGICAL BRUSH, and a FAKEMUSTACHE. But 
if you do get bumped off make sure you pick up the RED JACKET and an ETHER. 
Then continue onto the next room which contains a save point, save your game 
and heal your wounds if any. Then make your way to the next room, in this 
room its a bit tricky. The ceiling will constantly drop and move up, avoid 
getting crushed and move to each treasure chest and STAY IN FRONT OF THE 
TREASURE CHEST! That is primarily the safest position in the room, pick up 
the ZEPHYR CAPE and HERO RING(NOTE: Having the Sprint Shoes really helps in 
here). 

NOTE: The third treasure chest in the room which is on the far left of the 
      room IS NOT SAFE! Do not stay in front of it otherwise you will get 
      crushed. What I do is after the second treasure chest I make my way 
      down to the bottom left of the room and wait for the ceiling to lift 
      up(with the help of the Sprint Shoes of course) and then pick up the 
      TACK STAR. 

Then continue onto the next room and in here you will have to hop across 
treasure chests, as you do make sure you hit the switch near the entrance of 
the room as well. In this room there is a THUNDER SHLD as well, then continue 
onto the next room and in here talk to the figure in the middle of the room:

  "Shrouded in odd clothing, ...is this a man...? ...a woman...? ...or should
   we ask...?

Here you will be given the chance to name this man or woman, just name him
Gogo and be on with it. Here he will mimic your actions in battle only if he 
deems you worthy, quite modest if you ask me. The party tells Gogo what they 
are doing here and he is a bit astonished by their tale and decides to help 
them out because they want to right the wrongs. Now that he is with you, you 
can have him in your party at any time by rearranging your party members on 
yur airship.

=============================================================================
DESPERATION ATTACKS
Items: NA
Party: NA
Recommended level: NA
=============================================================================

Okay I'm too lazy to list out all the attacks(actually there are only 12 in 
the game. Umaro, Gau, and Gogo do not have desperation attacks because they 
have no FIGHT commands. Basically when your HP is down and your character 
starts to show signs of fatigue, there is a 1/20 chance that the attack will 
come out. These desperation attacks are vastly powerful and often very worthy 
of eye candy. Enjoy!

=============================================================================
NARCHE, MOG, UMARO
Items: Rune Edge, Moogle Charm, Elixir, Cursed Shield, Ragnarok, 5000GP,
       Wall Ring, Hyper Wrist, Theif Knife, Sneak Ring
Party: Locke and whomever
Recommended level: 29
=============================================================================

Head to Narche and inside there is a wolf that will tell you that there is
basically nothing left to do here and only a treasure hunter can pick those
locks. Wait a minute, you do have Locke right? Good then have him in your
party. Now head to the weapons shop and go downstairs and talk to the old
man, he will give you a magicite, you can except it as the magicite Ragnarok
or have the sword Ragnarok, it doesn't matter. But I would take the sword
because if you have the Paladin Shield that means you can learn Ultima,
but the Ragnarok Esper can morph opponents into items. 

You decide, then head for the house above the relics shop and speak with the 
sick man downstairs and he will give you the CURSED SHIELD, he mentions if 
you can break its curse imagine its defense power! You can break the curse by
equipping the shield and winning 255 battles with it and it will turn into 
the PALADIN SHIELD. But with the load times of the PSX, good luck! Ha! If you 
do equip the CURSED SHIELD make sure you have the RIBBON relic on as well, 
you can stop everything except for the Condemned status, and you must wear it 
and win battles as well. 

Now head to the west side of town to the mines through the old man's house 
from earlier in the game and find that moogle cave you found earlier in the 
game, inside talk to the Moogle inside and he will tell you not to scare him 
like that, the party as you can expect is surprised to hear that the moogle 
can talk.

  "Human-loving, fast-talking, street-smart, SLAM-dancing...Moogle..."

Here you will be given the chance to name him, so go ahead and name him Mog. 
Here it appears that the "old psycho, Ramuh" came to him in his dreams and 
said to be expecting the party. And now he is going to join your party and he 
mentions something about Yeti muscle, he says he is here somewhere in the 
mines and if they can find him Mog will order him to join the party. Now 
check the wall DIRECTLY behind moogle to recieve a MOOGLE CHARM. 

Now head towards the northern mines and along the way you will see a blue 
dragon walking around, approach it to initiate a fight, if you are strong 
enough. Check the 8 dragons section at the top of the Side Areas portion of 
the FF6 walkthrough on how to beat it.  If you do decide to fight it, there 
is a save point just above, its in the exact same position as you saw it when
Kefka tried to raid Narche for the esper. Then continue on and you will see 
the esper you protected earlier, it will attack you.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS BATTLE: Tritoch       HP: 30,000
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this battle use any one of your strong magic attacks. Don't use any
elemental based attack or else you will heal him. Use your Blitz attacks
SwdTech Rage, etc. Keep your HP above 1000 to survive his Ice 3 attack. He 
will occasionally use Rasp which will drain away a porion of your MP, but 
make sure to keep your MPs in check.

After the battle you will have freed him from the prison of ice and he still 
can't believe that the war has lasted over a thousand years(it really hasn't 
since he was in ice for so long) and he will then lend you his power. Then 
afterwards an opening in the cliff will open up and go towards it and jump 
in. Then head for the left side and drop to the floor below and pick up the 
GUANTLET and go back to the upper floor and to the left is a treasure chest 
containing an X-ETHER, then take the MIDDLE staircase and then in this 
room(the one in which you started in) take the left but avoid the pitfalls as 
you can clearly see by the shading on the floor. 

Then go towards the treasure chest and you will be attacked by three Pugs, 
and this battle is pretty tough. They will use Pearl in this battle so keep
your HP above 800, but they will use Pearl as a counter attack against your 
Ultima attack. After the battle they will give you a MINERVA. Then go back to 
the room to the right and take the path all the way to the right and here you 
will drop to the bottom floor. Here make your way to the top room through the 
wooden bridge. Here in this room you will see a switch, ignore that switch 
and go to the right and hit that switch and you will fall to the room below. 
Here in this room DO NOT HEAD FOR THE DOOR JUST YET! Check the skull in the 
middle of the room and take the magicite Terrato out of the eye and then a 
monster will approach you and attack you.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS BATTLE: Yeti       HP: 17,200
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This battle will be pretty easy, his physical attacks do pitiful damage. Use 
your most powerful magics in this battle and keep your HP up above 150 HP to 
survive its Blizzard attack, yes he is that weak.

After the battle have Mog talk to the Yeti monster and Mog will order him to 
join the party, and he does.

  "Admirer of bone-carvings, as strong as a gigas, a yeti pal with muscle!"

Here you will be given the chance to name him, just name him Umaro and be on 
with it. After the battle he will either join your current party or if your 
current party is full he will leave for the "big airship." Congratulations! 
You have now acquired a ton of new items and you have some new allies!

=============================================================================
MAGIC TOWER AND KEFKA'S TREASURE
Items: Safety Bit, Gem Box, Air Anchor, Stunner, Genji Shield, Force Armor
Party: Whomever
Recommended level: 50
=============================================================================

  NOTE: In this tower you can only use magic, your fight command WILL NOT
        show up on your command screen. Gogo however can use his fight
        command if you give him the fight command. Also monsters in here
        can be destroyed without knocking away their HP, if you use Osmose
        on some of these monsters they will die out as well.

Head for the Magic Tower, the place where you acquired Strago in. Here head
for the top of the tower. Its pretty linear, but its VERY long, like the
Pheonix Tower in FF5, except its not that long. In the first part of the 
tower and there is a door leading to a treasure chest, inside is a SAFETY BIT 
relic, go to the right of the treasure chest and check the wall and you will 
hear a noise, go outside and a door below you will open and enter it and pick 
up the AIR ANCHOR for Edgar. 

In the next part of the tower is another room leading to a GENJI SHLD, pick 
that up and continue onto the third part of the tower. In the third part of 
the tower is a STUNNER as well as a dragon, check the 8 Dragons portion of 
the Side Area section on how to defeat it. After picking that up go towards 
the fourth part of the tower and pick up the FORCE ARMOR. Then continue to 
the top of the tower and pick up the GEM BOX, then leave, but as you do a 
slew of ghosts will stop you and tell you to put back Kefka's treasure, but 
you can't since its too late. Then the MagiMaster will make his way around 
and attack you.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS BATTLE: MagiMaster      HP: 50,000
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: In this battle you can Berserk him, his physical attacks are weak and
      he won't cast Ultima at the end because he's in Berserk mode. However
      if you do not have the magic Berserk, then follow the battle plan 
      below.

This boss is one tough customer. Immediately cast Life 3 on as many party
members as you can in this battle prior to beating him and keep your HP at a 
constant Max. Use all your strong magics like Meteor, Ultima, Flare, or 
Pearl. He is immensely powerful, his Fire 2 attack does about 1000 HP of 
damage, yes a weak spell like that does massive damage. Keep repeating the 
pattern and when you defeat him he will use Ultima, which will cause at LEAST 
5500 HP to every character, and if one character is standing it will do 9999 
HP of damage, but since Life 3 was cast prior to him using Ultima your 
character will come back to life.

After the battle the GEM BOX relic is now yours which lets you cast two
consecutive magics in one round.

=============================================================================
CYAN'S NIGHTMARE
Items: Remedy, Ice Shield, X-Potion, Flame Shield, Genji Glove, Beads, Ether,
       Elixir, Phoenix Down, Lump Of Metal
Party: Cyan and whomever
Recommended level: 38
=============================================================================

Remember Doma Castle? Head back there which is on the small island west of
the Veldt and make sure you have Cyan in your party. Earlier in the World of 
Balance this place was overrun with imperial troops, but after the incident 
most of the imperial troops were caught in the aftermath of the day of Kefka. 
Inside here there is an ETHER, and take the room to the right and sleep, but 
Cyan however is still asleep. Then three kids come in and introduce 
themselves being Curley, Larry, and Moe(what a coincidence). 

They are the three dream stooges and they want Cyan's soul and they all jump 
in Cyan's head as does the party. Here you will start off with your party
members divided, now you will have to find the others. Here take the left and 
then take the right door, and you will find your other party member 
unconsious, but one of the dream stooges walks off until he can reunite with 
his other borhters. Check with your party member to see if he or she is 
alright and then head to the door on the right. 

In here take the door on the top, now take the door on the right and your 
other party member is unconsious, but the other dream stooge runs off. Check 
your party member and then head to the left door. Here take the left side and 
enter that door. In here walk to the door and go inside, but before you can 
do that the three dream stooges bump you off.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS FIGHT: Curly, Larry, Moe     HP: 15,000(C) 10,000(L) 12,500(M)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
As you cna expect in this battle use your best magic attacks. Use your Blitz, 
Rage, Tools, etc. Keep your HP up above 400 at all times unless you have 
something that can absorb lightnign or fire. I suggest keeping your magic 
spread in this battle, don't try to concentrate your attacks on one dream 
stooge otherwise if they recover they will immediately pull off their Delta 
Attack, which will stone a character(as seen in FFIV and FFV). They can 
revive as many times as needed to defeat you, but if you keep casting Ultima 
or Meteo they should go down one after the other.

After the battle go through the door and you will find a familiar place.
Its the Ghost Train, keep going towards the left and you will see Cyan being 
chased by a ghost, follow him inside. There is a treasure chest that can be 
accessed by pulling the switch near the door, you must go around and pick it 
up, but do it quickly otherwise you will not be able to reach it because the 
box will go back to its position if you are too slow, so having the SPRINT 
SHOES relic really helps here. Pick up the GENJI GLOVE and then go to the far 
left of this box car and pick up the lump of metal, after doing that put it 
in the treasure chest that would block your path each time you tried to reach 
for the treasure chest. Pick up the FLAME SHLD and then hit the switch to the 
left:

       A A B        A= Opened treasure chest
       B B A        B= Closed treasure chest

Memorize these positions as it saids so on the open book on the desk as it 
may save you. Then continue onto the left side to the next box car. Here in 
this box car hit the first switch and pick up the ICE SHLD and then hit the 
other switch to the left. Now go back to the first switch and hit the switch 
which will move the couch back to its regular position and it will clear the 
way for you to hit the middle switch. Hit the middle switch and then hit the 
first switch to the right. Then after that hit the last switch to the left 
and the two boxes will move out of the way and you can go under and to the 
other side. Here its the same set up with the treasure chests again, did you 
remember the pattern? Then do the exact same pattern that you saw earlier and 
then hit the switch and the left side's wall will open up. 

Now continue onto the next box car and inside is a save point so save your 
game and heal your wounds and continue onto the engine room to the left. In 
here there are three switches at the top right side, reverse the switches and 
then head out and this time you will be in magitek armor. Make your way 
outside and then go back inside, you heard me. If you continue to the right 
you will just continue to go around in circles. In here make your way around 
and outside you will see Cyan, he will run pass the bridge, as you follow him 
the bridge below will break and send you down below. You will now awaken in 
the room you rested in but you are still in Cyan's dream. 

Then Owain and Elayne will tell you to save Cyan, they tell you that you are 
inside Cyan's soul. Cyan continues to torture himself because he failed to 
defend Doma, the world is slowly dying, and then there's his family. A beast 
known as Wrexsoul is taking advantage of this situation, he is a monster made 
up of wretched souls made up or spirits from meaningless wars. Now a save 
point will pop up, so save your game and heal your wounds if any and then 
make your way to the center of the castle and you will see Cyan unconsious 
and Wrexsoul has already begun his dirty work, but its not too late.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS BATTLE: Wrexsoul & SoulSaver      HP: Wrexsoul(23,066) Soul Saver(3,066)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: When Wrexsoul is on the screen, cast X-Zone and he should be gone.
      Here in this battle he tells you that he will come back when you are 
      about to expire. THIS IS A CLUE! He then leaves. Don't bother with the 
      SoulSavers because you cannot destroy them because no matter HOW MANY 
      times you kill them they will come back to life. First aim your attacks 
      at your party members and knock out everybody except one. After that he 
      will come back and now strike him with everything you've got and revive 
      your party members and blast back for Cyan's sake. If he disappears do 
      the whole process again except you will have to have the party member 
      that was alive, when Wrexsoul came back, kill him or her and have a new 
      party member standing when Wrexsoul comes back. After the battle you 
      will recieve the POD BRACELET.

After the battle Cyan thanks you and he heard his wife and child calling to 
him and they gave him the courage to fight his own suffering. Then Owain and 
Elayne comes in, but Cyan feels that he is a man with no honor, but his 
family doesn't believe so. After the battle they say their last goodbyes for 
now and a sword appears, Cyan reaches for it and the party is now out of his 
nightmare. After the nightmare Cyan realizes that he has to forget about the 
past nad clears his soul of all doubt and confusion.

Then his swordsmanship level attain its peak level of skill meaning that you 
will now have full access to all his SwdTech abilities! Just try the Quadra 
Slice on level 7 and you'll be amazed! Now head back to the throne room in 
which you saw the magicite sitting on the chair and pick it up to recieve the 
magicite ALEXANDR. Now that you have ALEXANDR and all of Cyan's SwdTech 
abilties you'll be unstoppable!

=============================================================================
STRAGO'S UNRELIEVING PAST
Items: Coral
Party: Relm, Strago, and whomever
Recommended level: 42
=============================================================================

Now head for Thamasa on the bottom right corner of the world map and inside
talk a scenario will automatically take place in here. NOTE: You must have
Strago and Relm in your party to comeplete this side-quest. Here inside Relm 
is pretty excited to be back home as Strago is just as excited as its time to 
relax, "home sweet home." Then Relm tells Strago that Gungho is hurt, the two 
go to check on him and it appears that Hidon, a beast that Strago and Gungho 
used to hunt, was the one responsible. He seems badly hurt and tells Strago 
to avenge him, but Strago hesistates.

It was no sweat when he was younger, but at his age its a lot more than he
had bargained for but he finally agrees and decides to avenge Gungho. Then
Relm wants to come along, but Strago spent to many years hunting for it and 
it's his obsession not Relm's. Relm wants to go but as its name implies the 
Hidon is extremely difficult to find, unless he goes alone it will not show 
itself. Relm then stays behind but decides to follow him anyways. Now that 
Strago and Relm have left your party, head towards Ebot's Rock up north and a 
opening inside will open up. Follow them inside but do not add any additional 
party members to your group. 

In here its clear tunnel vision from here on end, walk straight up and hit 
the switch and you will be transported to the next area. In here there is a 
treasure chest, talk to it and it will not let you pass unless you feed it 
some coral, but where can you find any? Now head down to the switch and in 
this room there is a save point up top so if you want you can save your game, 
but you really didn't do much. Now head towards the bottom switch and in this 
next room there is a treasure chest to the left which contains 3 pieces of 
CORAL. 

Then continue onto the left and step on the switch to the next area and you 
will be back at the area where the treasure chest would not let you through. 
But now that you have some Coral feed it to him and he will eat it, but he 
still wants more. So head back to the bottom switch and you should be near 
the entrance, step on the switch again and to the right is another treasure 
chest containing a piece of CORAL, then head for the switch at the bottom. In
this room head for the bottom left and pick up 2 pieces of CORAL and then 
head for the switch directly to the right. In this room check the treasure 
chest for 3 pieces of CORAL and then head all the way to the right for 
another 3 pieces of CORAL and then step on the switch to the right. 

Now in this room save your game and heal your wounds if any and then head for
the switch to the next room. Here in this room head for the top and pick up 
three pieces of CORAL and then head for the switch to the right of that and 
here in this room pick up 5 pieces of CORAL to the left and then head for the 
top switch and you will be back at the treasure chest that wanted some more 
CORAL. Feed your new stash, but he's so greedy and still wants some more. So 
head down to the switch and in this room there is a treausure chest to the 
left to pick up a piece of CORAL and then head up to the next switch. 

Here in this room step on the switch leading to the next room and in here 
check the bottom for 2 pieces of CORAL and then head for the top left switch. 
In this room pick up 5 pieces of CORAL to the right and then step on the 
switch to the next room. Here there is 2 pieces of CORAL to the left, then 
head further left and onto the next switch. In this room there is another 
treasure chest to the left containing 3 pieces of CORAL, then make your way 
to the left and step on that switch. In this next room to the left is 3 
pieces of CORAL, after that step on the switch leading to the next room. Here 
in this room to the left is 3 pieces of CORAL, then head for the right side 
and step on the switch. 

Here there is a switch to the right of you, GO AROUND it and to the top to 
pick up 3 pieces of CORAL and then head for the switch to the left. In this 
next room head straight up and pick up 2 pieces of CORAL and to the bottom 
right of this room pick up 3 pieces of CORAL and then hit the switch to the 
right and you should be at the entrance of Ebot's Rock. Step on it again and
you will be at the entrance again, but step on the switch up top and onto the 
next room. Here there is a save point at the top, so definitely save your 
game and heal your wounds if any and continue onto the next room via the 
switch at the bottom. 

You will be at the same room again, so hit the switch at the bottom again, 
you will be at the same save room again so hit the switch once more. Here in 
this room head down below to pick up a piece of CORAL and then step on the 
switch to the left of it and in this next room which looks the same as the 
last one, head down below and pick up 5 pieces of CORAL and then step on the 
switch to the left of the tresure chest. Here is another save point, so save 
your game if you want and heal your wounds if you want and then continue on. 
There is another save point in this room, but ignore it and continue on. 

In this room check the treasure chest to the left and pick up a piece of 
CORAL and then head to the bottom left of this room and step on the switch to 
the next room. You will now be in the room with the coral eating treasure 
chest, feed him your next stash and he will be completely full. He hesistates 
for a while and gives out his odor, the party then gets agitated and reminds 
him symbolically that they want to get through. So he does, then walk up the 
middle and and talk to it to initiate a fight.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS BATTLE: Hidon & Hidonite(4)      HP: 25,000(Hidon) 3,000(Hidonite)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this battle its best that you spread your magic. Your first priority is to 
get the Hidonites and then attack Hidon, so any strong spread magic will 
do(ala Ultima). Once they are out of the way Hidon will use his GrandTrain 
attack, it does massive damage so its good to keep your HP above 1100 just to 
be safe. He will use Poison, so cure it once he does. After the battle you 
will recieve a WARP STONE. NOTE: If Hidon uses his GrandTrain attack on 
Strago that means Strago will learn it after the battle. Note that it is his 
STRONGEST Lore attack and its quite powerful.

NOTE: If you do not get the GrandTrain Lore Magic, you can re-visit this
      place again and fight him again, however its a pain to go through
      Ebot's Rock again, but its WELL worth it!

Here after the battle Strago is excited that he has beaten Hidon, he then 
tells Gungho that he is avenged. He then tells the good news to Gungho and 
Gungho is shocked. Gungho then gets all cheery and jittery and Strago asks 
how are his wounds healing, and Gungho says their fine. Then that evening 
Strago and Gungho are talking over it in the middle of the night. He stared 
Hidon in the middle of the eyes, lifted his staff, and let him have it! 
Strago wanted to show his enemy the true meaning of the word "hero." Then 
Gungho walks outside and talks to Relm, Gungho tells her that he's off and 
talks about his wounds. 

But before he can talk Relm wants to thank him, Gungho gave Strago a reason 
that has tormented Strago for decades, even if he was faking Hidon meant 
business. Gungho is equally amazed at the granddaughter Strago raised as he 
is at the defeat of Hidon by Strago. But Relm reminds him of his terrible
acting, only Strago could have been taken in by such an awful performance! 
Gungho gets agitated as Relm runs inside the house. Now you have successfully 
defeat Hidon and hopefully you did learn GRANDTRAIN, if not then I have one 
word for you: "Gameshark"

THE LOST CASTLE AND THE REIGN OF ODIN
Items: Ether, X-Ether, Wing Edge, Gold Hairpin, Punisher, Offering, Magicite,
       Blizzard Orb, Trump
Party: Whomever
Recommended level: 40
=============================================================================

Remember where you had last left Figaro Castle? Right on the top most eastern 
continent on the desert. Return there and tell the driver that you want to go 
to Figaro. During the middle of your voyage the driver notices something odd 
about the stratum, he will ask you if you want to start again or stop. Choose 
stop and head for the basement where the jailors were previously kept. In 
here to the far right the door has opened up, so go inside and in this room 
and pick up an ETHER and another WING EDGE for Locke then head to the right 
door and check the treasure chest and a Master Pug will attack you.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS BATTLE: Master Pug    HP: 22,000    ITEM: Gradeus
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This guy is TOUGH. Use your most powerful magics and Blitz, SwdTech, Lore,
etc. to defeat this guy. Keep your HP above 1500, he will counter attack with 
StepMine everytime you attack him which causes about near 1400 HP of damage, 
so you will need to heal after it, if your levels are too low then your gone, 
so bring that character back to life. Don't use any elemental attacks against 
it because it will absorb your attacks. Strago's GrandTrain Lore attack works 
here as he will not counter attack against it. He will constantly change 
barriers so unless you know exactly what he is weak against, then avoid using 
elemental attacks. NOTE: Strago here can learn Step Mine from Master Pug, it 
does not have to connect on him either!

Now afterwards head for either door to the left, along the way make sure you 
pick up the TRUMP for Setzer and then continue onto the left. In this next 
room to the left is an X-POTION and to the bottom is a MAGICITE. After that 
take the stairs down and in here there is a save point, so save your game and 
heal your wounds if any then continue onto the left. The party then notices a 
gaint castle and a scenario of a portion of the War of the Magi takes place. 
The guards are immediately taken out as an esper shows them its magic, but 
another guard wants to show them his esper magic.

It was a thousand years in the past that a battle was waged here, the guards 
ask if Odin's wounds are healed, but it appears that the guards are fresh out 
of options so they will leave the battle in Odin's hands. Odin then shows the 
espers his Atom Edge in which gets them all, then another esper comes by as 
Odin tries his Atom Edge, it doesn't work. The esper then turns Odin into 
stone, but Odin tells him not to turn him into a magicite, so the esper 
doesn't. The legend tells of a great battle between Odin and a powerful 
sorcerer. Now continue on and enter the left side of the castle and check the 
treasure chest and a KatanaSoul will attack you.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS BATTLE: KatanaSoul       HP: 37,620    ITEM: Offering
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here in this battle its pretty straight forward, attack him with every one of 
your strong magic attacks. Watch for his Imperial Dart attack, it will kill 
you even if you are at 9999 HP. He will also use GP Rain and that will take 
off massive damage as well, keep your HP at max if possible and keep on 
attacking. Watch for his Ashura Dart attack which causes near 8300 HP of 
damage, so you can't do much about that, basically keep your HP up and 
attack.

After the battle go to the inside of the castle and to the throne room and
touch the Odin statue, it will turn into a Magicite Shard. Now continue to 
the top right and into the room and pick up a GOLD HAIRPIN and a BLIZZARD
ORB, and they are both relics. Now go to the right and down the stairs check 
the sparkling orb, it tells that the queen is in love with Odin and it breaks 
every single rule in her society. If Terra is in your party she will realize 
the love between an esper and a human. Now check the right pot in the room to 
pick up an X-ETHER. Now return to the middle of the throne room and go one 
step down from where Odin was standing and hit the "A" button on the SNES 
version or hit the "X" button on the PSX version and a switch will open up. 

Return to the room where you read the Queen's diary and a staircase will now 
open up go down the ascending staircase and there is a blue dragon in here, 
if you think your strong enough to fight it then do so, check my guide above 
if you have trouble defeating it. Afterwards go to the center statue in this 
room and you will see that the queen has been turned to stone, then a tear 
comes from the statue as Odin gains to the next level and becomes Raiden. 
Don't worry if you didn't learn METEOR from Odin, if you've defeated all the 
dragons you will get Crusader and learn METEOR 10 times as fast. Afterwards 
you will now have the esper Raiden in your hands!

=============================================================================
GAU'S LOST FATHER
Items: None
Party: Gau, Sabin, and whomever
Recommended level: NA
=============================================================================

  NOTE: You must have talk to this man with Sabin and Edgar prior to having
        Gau in your party. The old man will tell you to use the chair to
        reach the roof, but the two leave and outside they wonder if it is
        Gau's father.

Now on the top right corner of the map is a large island north of the Veldt
and at the top left tip of the island is a small house. Go inside with Gau in 
your party and talk to the old man inside. He will tell you to leave unless 
your a repairman, Gau will seem a bit startled. Now as the party leaves the 
place and Gau will seem a bit dumbfounded. Sabin wants to know if that's 
really his father, but Gau doesn't even know if that is his father himself. 
But Sabin thinks that's definitely his father, and the party decides to go in 
and tell the old man the good news. But Gau can't go in looking like that so 
they head over to Jidoor. 

In here(Shadow, Gogo, Umaro, and Mog are abscent from the picture here even 
though you have found all of them, why? Because it would be too much of a 
hassle to put in all variations of this scenario) the party teaches Gau good 
manners and teach him how to speak properly, then Terra helps Gau select out 
his clothes along with Cyan and Celes. The party finally decide on Gau's new 
clothes but they are a bit funky as Setzer suggests that Gau wears the 
hippest clothes to date, like the one's Setzer are wearing. Afterwards Gau 
are in his new clothes as they walk inside, Sabin tells the aged man that he 
had a son right? 

Then introduces Gau, the aged man denies that he ever had a son, but now that 
they mentioned it he talks about his horrible dream that a demon-child was 
born. He says that he grabbed the child and rushed it off to the Veldt and it 
was crying like crazy when he was at the Veldt. He left the child there and 
started to run never looking back, but then the crying stops as he saw a 
frightful monster, never has he saw such horror. 

He tells Sabin that his parents must have been proud of them but he still 
dreams of that demon-child, but after several tries to talk to the aged man, 
Sabin becomes angry at him and wants to clobber him, but Gau stops him and 
leaves outside. Sabin apologizes, and Gau realizes that he is happy. What a 
rotten father.

=============================================================================
THE LOST MAGICITE
Items: Palidor Magicite
Party: Whomever
Recommeneded level: NA
=============================================================================

Remember the island Celes was on when she first arrived here? Yes its on the 
bottom left corner of the world map on that lonely little island. Go inside 
the house and onto the shore, and you will see a magicite near the waters. 
Pick it up to recieve the Magicite Palidor. That's it!

=============================================================================
THE ESPER AUCTION
Items: Zoneseek Magicite, Golem Magicite
Party: Whomever
Recommended level: NA
=============================================================================

Remember when you were in the World of Balance and in Jidoor you couldn't bet 
in the auction because the auction was always over when you got there? Well 
in the World of Ruin you can now go to Jidoor on the western part of the 
world map. In here head for the auction and sometimes there is a special item 
that can be auctioned for, no not the 1/20 of an airship because even if you 
do have 1 million GP, you can never buy it. But there are two espers in here 
that you can auction for and they are the GOLEM and ZONESEEK esper. Its not 
always there when you go, but keep going back and forth and you should get 
the chance to purchase them for about 40,000 GP.

=============================================================================
THE DEMON THAT ROAMS THE AIR
Items: Bahamut Magicite
Party: Whomever
Recommended level: 32
=============================================================================

In the World of Ruin, on your airship fly around the World of Ruin, fly 
around the world and eventually a DoomGlaze will attack you.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOSS BATTLE: DoomGlaze     HP: 55,555
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This battle shouldn't be too hard. Keep attacking him until he's gone. He 
will leave after you lose him about 8,000 HP. NOTE: You can defeat him 
quickly like you can with most bosses by first casting Vanish on him and then 
X-Zone. Its a qucik victory yes, but you will not get the BAHAMUT esper.

After the battle keep roaming around the world and the DoomGlaze will 
approach you again. Keep doing this five times and he will drop a BAHAMUT 
esper. Congratulations! You have now recived the strongest esper in the game, 
too bad Leviathan was never in this game!

=============================================================================
SHADOW IN RETROSPECT
Items: NA
Party: Shadow and whomever
Recommended level: NA
=============================================================================

Have Shadow in your party after you saved him and go through various inns
around the world, each time you do, you will see a portion of his past. This 
is pretty neat because the flashbacks and recollections for the other 
characters in the game occur during the storyline.

                              Esper Magic System
                              ------------------

  Final Fantasy VI introduces a new system which has been dubbed the "Esper
  System" in which previous Final Fantasy games you had to buy magic(Final
  Fantasy) or earn them by levels(Final Fantasy IV). However the Esper system
  does neither instead as you find and search for espers, they turn into
  magicite and you will inherit all the magics the esper has to offer just
  as long as you fight in battle with them. At the end of each battle you
  will earn Magic Points, and no they are not your MP. Instead consider them
  as something like Ability Points if you may. Okay, lets say you have Raiden
  and Meteor is at 10%, that means when you earn 1 magic point, you will
  earn 10 magic points, so its basically a bit of multiplying. When you reach
  100% for that certain magic you will have already learned that magic.
  Some magics take very little battles to learn or they may take a lot, it
  all depends. Also everybody learns the magic at the same rate, with a few
  exceptions. Sometimes you don't even need a magicite to learn magic, for
  example if you have the PALADIN shield equipped during battle, you can
  learn Ultima, your progress can be seen on the magic listing menu. Terra
  and Celes can learn magic on their own but it takes a very long time to
  learn them all. Also you can learn up to six different magics at a time
  or as many as the esper has because you will earn magic points for all the
  magics that are on the esper. Once each character has learned at least
  one magic spell, a Magic command will automatically pop up on the battle
  screen. Below here are a list of different magic spells that can be learned
  and a brief description of each and also the espers and the magics that
  you can learn from them.


  NOTE: When you recieve a Magicite as an item, it does not mean that its
        a new esper, its actually a random summon to be used in battle. And
        as you can expect there are relics that decrease the amount of MP
        used during battle like the Economizer or Gold Hairpin.

Mute     MP: 8

  them to use magic. Use a REMEDY or the Remedy spell to cure.

--------------
Safe    MP: 12

  This magic will put a Safe protectant seal around the party member which
  protects against physical attacks making all physical attacks half
  effective from normal effectiveness. Can be taken down with Dispel.

--------------

--------------
Haste   MP: 10
--------------
  This magic will make either the opposition or party member's wait guage
  go faster allowing for more attacks in a SLIGHTLY shorter amount of time.
  IF you are dumb enough to cure this, use Slow.

--------------
Stop    MP: 10
--------------
  This magic causes either the opposition or your party member to become
  paralyzed making them uneffective during battle. This can only be cured
  with the Dispel spell or if you wait until your character snaps out of it.

--------------
Berserk MP: 16
--------------
  This magic will make either the opposition or your party member go
  berserk, unable to control themselves they will go into a fury that causes
  critical hits the majority of the times and the wait guage is always full.
  Becareful on using it on a party member, they cannot use items or magic
  when they are in this status.

--------------
Float   MP: 17
--------------
  This magic will cause the party members to float, thus allowing you to
  avoid damage floors like magma and lets you avoid Quake attacks during
  battle. Can be spread among party members.

--------------
Imp     MP: 10
--------------
  This magic can be used against either the opposition or a party member
  as it will turn the target into an Imp causing the defense and attack
  power to drop. This can be used even if you are on Mute status and can
  be used to cure Imp status on an effected party member. NOTE: On the
  Dinosaur forest you can defeat the dinosaurs for Imp weapons, which are
  rather effective in Imp status.

--------------
Rflect  MP: 22
--------------
  This magic can be used either against the opposition or a party member and
  it will reflect any magic spell(except for W Wind, Merton, Meteor, Ultima,
  Quake, X-Zone, and Dispel) for a certain amount of rounds. If an opponent
  has a Wall set up, you can reflect your won magic off of your party member
  to damage the opposition.

--------------
Shell   MP: 15
--------------
  This magic will put up a protective barrier that cuts all magic attacks
  down in half with the exception of Ultima, Meteor, and W Wind. Can be
  taken down with Dispel.

--------------
Vanish  MP: 18
--------------
  This magic will make the opposition or party member vanish, causing hits
  to be less successfully effective. Cast this first and then X-Zone, and
  watch the majority of your opponents go off, even against most bosses!

--------------
Haste2  MP: 38
--------------
  This magic is like Haste except it will cast Haste to every member in your
  party or the oppositon allowing for less time between attacks to be 
  consumed. Can be disinfected with Dispel.

--------------
Slow 2  MP: 26
--------------
  This magic is like Slow except it will cast Slow to every party member in
  your party or the opposition allowing for more time between attacks to
  be consumed. Can be disinfected with Dispel.

--------------
Osmose   MP: 1
--------------
  This magic will allow you to absorb magic points from the opposition, 
  the more you need the more you absorb and the less you need the less you
  will absorb. One of the more useful spells in the game.

--------------
Warp    MP: 20
--------------
  This will allow the party member to escape a dungeon or used to escape
  from battle. Use this to get out of Kefka's Tower if you don't know how.

--------------
Quick   MP: 99
--------------
  This magic will allow for double commands to be executed while being
  completely uninterrupted. Very powerful.

--------------
Dispel  MP: 25
--------------
  This magic cannot be reflected as it will remove any spell effect from
  the opposition or party member. Even if the magic effects are layered
  one cast can remove all. You can only remove Safe, Shell, Wall, Haste,
  and Slow.

  Well that's it, sure the game offers Bonus Mode, but then there's the
  slowdown that you have to deal with, so its your choice, but for me it

  This section was mainly provided by the Bonus section in FFVI, thanks a lot
  Square! On the world map northwestern part, you will find a castle of some
  sort that looks a lot like the Opera House. Inside you can bet your current
  items and place them against an opponent HOPEFULLY for a better prize.
  NOTE: If you bet items that you can buy, you will face off against Chupon,
        who will most likely use his Sneeze attack and blow you out of battle
        but you do not lose the item you placed bet on.

                               Best Times
                               ----------

  Final Fantasy VI:
  First Time Playing: 28:12
  Best Time Playing: 6:03
  Best Time playing through all(including Side Areas and all obtaining all
       magic spells and reaching level 99): 69:14


  NOTE: The clock in both the SNES and PSX versions are not accurate times
        and they are 50% slower, so you will need to double the actual
        hours in the game to get your actual total Real Time.
