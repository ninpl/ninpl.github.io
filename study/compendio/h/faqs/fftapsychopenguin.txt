If you contact me on one of the instant messengers, and I do not respond, it
probably means I am busy. I am always talking with my girl, and friends, so
sometimes I just ignore some instant messages from people I do not know. Be
nice, and I will talk to you, just don't come out and ask the question and be
all rude if I do not respond in five seconds, otherwise I probably will just
block you. I will answer all e-mails about the game, however.

One last note: Only email me about the game at penguin_faqs@yahoo.com, all
emails about Final Fantasy Tactics Advance sent to my other e-mail addresses
will be deleted and/or ignored. Thanks to all those that have emailed me so
far, I appreciate it!

1. Check my email backlog. If it's filled up, you may have to wait a while
before you get a response.

2. I check my email once in a while. Please wait for a response, because I
will respond to all emails.

3. Please read my guide before asking questions, that's why I have a FAQ and
Reader Tips section.

4. I will only post your question/tip in my guide if it is good, and has not
been answered in this guide.

New plan: all questions can be sent to mcfaddenvg@yahoo.com and if you have
anything you would like to add to the guide, send it to
mcfa4834@bellsouth.net. This is because it is too tough for me to separate
stuff people want me to add to the guide from basic questions. if you send any
reader tips to mcfaddenvg@yahoo.com or any questions to
mcfa4834@bellsouth.net, they will be deleted. Thanks for understanding.

Thanks!

Well, in my never-ending quest to write for every Final Fantasy game on the US
market, I have been led to Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. I really suck at
writing for these kind of games, which is why I never attempted to write for
Final Fantasy Tactics (which is one of my all time favorite games) yet.

I am not pretending to be an expert on this game, because I am not. I'm sure
the message board and other FAQ writers will know far more about this game
than I will. But, I will try my hardest to figure out everything and then put
it into this guide. I hope you find this to be a nice source of FFTA info, but
it will never be the top FFTA guide out there.

Well then, hope you enjoy my first attempt at a FAQ for a strategy game, and
make sure to email me with any questions you have!

Like I stated above, I am not claiming to be an expert on Final Fantasy
Tactics Advance at all. I will try my hardest to provide as in-depth
information as possible. I am not going to wow you with a fancy game basics
section, but I will try my best to provide information into all of the
important aspects of the game.

My biggest strength here will be my ability to provide you with in-depth job
and ability sections, as well as breaking down every mission in the game. I
suck at game basics, like I said, but I will definitely be strong in the
walkthrough department.

Basically, if you're looking for a quality, in-depth complete breakdown of
FFTA, you might not find it here. But, if you're looking for a way to get
through that tough battle, or an in-depth analysis of the Paladin class, you
may have come to the right place here.

I hope you enjoy my first attempt at writing for a strategy game!

I'm going to be honest with you, Final Fantasy Tactics Advance is not exactly
what I expected. I expected a fun portable version of Final Fantasy Tactics.
When I heard they were making a new game, I was pretty excited. Then, I
started to hear the news. They were taking out the wonderfully addictive job
and ability system of the original Final Fantasy Tactics, and replacing it
with something new.

I was shocked. Here they had the chance to make the most addictive portable
game since Pokemon, and they replaced the ability system with something
straight out of Final Fantasy 9. That is the only really disappointing aspect
of the game, in my opinion, and something that sadly prevents it from becoming
a true classic.

Regardless, the game still is damn fun. It might not be as good as I
anticipated, but I am still enjoying it to a certain extent, and I hope you
are too.

My name is Psycho Penguin, and I've been writing at GameFAQs for well over
four years now. My original love was reviewing, and I have more reviews than
almost anyone else on the website. However, I soon began to develop a passion
for FAQ writing, and after I finished my first really big project (Parasite
Eve), I was hooked.

Since then, I've mainly written for role playing games, and I soon had a goal:
to become the first writer on the website to write for all the Final Fantasy
games. I am quickly reaching my goal, and this guide will take me another step
closer towards completing this goal of mine I've had for well over 2 years
now.

I do have other hobbies, of course. I like to play games, but I also love to
write all sorts of stuff, read, play sports, exercise, watch movies, and watch
wrestling. I am also a HUGE sports freak, as weekends are basically devoted to
watching football non stop.

deep and engrossing gameplay. I don't know everything about the game, but I

storyline from the instruction manual in a future version.

| SECTTWO2 | ------------------------------------------- [ 2.2 BATTLE SYSTEM ]
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

The battle system is pretty complex to figure out at first, but once you get
the hang of it, it is really no problem. You get to move around on a
battlefield grid. When you move into the area you wish to move to, you get to
choose between one of several abilities. Each ability does something
different. If you choose to attack, you can, but each attack has a certain
range to it.

For instance, a normal physical attack will only stretch one or two spaces (at
most), but you can do a "special attack", including magic, which will spread
several spaces across. Therefore, I advise having all characters in your party
having a long range attack, so all enemies are in trouble at all times.

There are two things to pay attention to while you are doing an attack. Check
the lower left hand corner, and you will see a rectangle with two numbers in
it. A percentage will show up, which indicates the percentage you have that
the attack will land without missing.

You will also see a minus sign and a number next to it. This indicates the
estimated damage that you will do if the attack lands. Both these numbers are
not guaranteed, but rather estimated, but you will get a good idea of how your
attack will fare from these two numbers alone.

For those of you that are used to the Final Fantasy Tactics game (and who
isn't, because it's such an awesome game, and I'm assuming you played that
before playing the portable version of it), you are familiar with Experience
and JP.

Experience still plays out the same way as it did before. Every time you
perform a command (and not just attack, either, you can do all sorts of
things, ranging from Item to Magic), you will get EXP, which helps you raise
levels. When you get 100 EXP, you raise a level, and then your statistics will
increase.

JP is a change from Final Fantasy Tactics, however. In that classic game,
Final Fantasy Tactics had JP, which helped you level up abilities. In this
game, you get JP from killing an enemy normally or using the ability of the
day (check section 2.5, judgment system, for more information). You use JP to
perform combo attacks. Once you get 100 JP, you can summon a creature.

I'll have more about the battle system in an upcoming version of the guide.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
| SECTTWO3 | ---------------------------------------- [ 2.3 ABILITIES SYSTEM ]
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

The abilities system has changed from Final Fantasy Tactics, as well. Hell,
now it seems to have taken a page directly from Final Fantasy IX. Now, in
order to gain abilities, you have to equip an armor or weapon, and then
extract abilities directly from them.

It is very important that you check the abilities that a weapon or armor has
before equipping it. You don't want to end up learning the same abilities over
and over again if you can help it, and some weapons and armor share similar
abilities to other weapons and armor, so make sure to keep track of that.

After each battle, the characters in your party will gain AP based off the
requirements of the battle. The AP you earn will go to each ability you have
equipped on both your weapons and armor. When you gain enough AP to master an
ability, you no longer have to have the weapon or armor equipped in order to
use it.

Magic also works in a similar way, in case you were wondering. Some job
classes come automatically equipped with some magic, but certain magic spells
can be learned only by equipping certain special weapons or armor.

In case you were wondering, AP is not split. Each ability can gain the same
amount of AP. For instance, if you are trying to learn 4 abilities, and you
gain 160 AP, each ability gets 160 AP, not 40. Also, each character gets it,
as well as each weapon and armor. Leveling up becomes pretty fun because of
this. ^_^

Also, the weapons and armor you equip will keep its AP regardless of whether
or not you switch while learning abilities, so don't worry about that. You
can't carry over AP to other weapons and armor, either, you only get AP for
the weapon or armor you have equipped.

I will have more on the unique abilities system in an upcoming version of the
guide.

| SECTTWO5 | -------------------------------------------- [ 2.5 OTHER BASICS ]
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Final Fantasy Tactics Advance is a pretty complex game, so I made a separate
section for basics that didn't fit into any of the other sections. Stay tuned
for a list of "things you should know before playing the game".

-------------------
| JUDGMENT SYSTEM |
-------------------
The judgment system is one of the most unique systems I have ever seen in a
video game, and Squaresoft finally got an original idea done that was pretty
fun to play.

It basically works like this: before each battle, a judge comes and selects
some laws, bars some abilities, and selects a special ability that will gain
you JP if you use it.

The laws are set at the beginning of the battle. They sometimes ban certain
commands (imagine not being able to use physical attacks for an entire
mission), as well as barring you from using abilities to kill enemies. If you
do so, there are punishments.

When you first break a law, you get a yellow card. This reduces your
statistics and prevents you from gaining AP at the end of a battle. And don't
think it goes away automatically, either. You have to go to jail, pay a fine,
and then fight several battles in good behavior before having the yellow card
removed.

If you break the law a few times, or kill an enemy by using a barred ability,
you get a red card and are sent straight to jail. You can't use the jailed
character for the remainder of the battle, and you have to pay a hefty fine to
get him out of jail.

However, there are some positives. If you kill an enemy normally, or if you
use the "special ability of the day", which is an ability the judge chooses
before the battle, you gain JP, which you can then use to do combo moves or
summon magic.

Here's an example of the judgment system. In Snow in Lutia mission, there is a
Thunder Ban. This means the people who are capable of casting Thunder are not
allowed to do so. If they cast it, and an enemy doesn't die, they get a yellow
card. Their statistics are now weakened, and they don't get AP after the
battle. If they cast Thunder and an enemy dies, they go to jail.

-------------------
| MISSIONS        |
-------------------
Going on missions is the main focus of Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. While
you only need to do a certain amount to complete the game, you can do side-
missions, which increase your statistics and net you valuable items and more.
To do so, select missions underneath the main mission. Some missions require
you to complete another mission before doing them, and other missions
(dispatch) missions require you to be a certain job class or fulfill another
obligation before partaking in them.

The key thing to remember about these dispatch missions is that Marche and
Montblanc cannot undergo them. If the mission requires a soldier, Marche
cannot be the only soldier in the party. You have to find someone else to
become a soldier, and then they can be dispatched to do the mission.

Here is a list of the types of missions in the game.

Story Based: These are the most expensive, and they advance the storyline and
open a new area when you win. Always located on top.

Battle: Like a story-based mission, only optional. These always cost a decent
amount of money and always require you to fulfill an obligation during battle.

Dispatch: This is where you send someone out on their own mission. Check the
Clan Levels section below on how to increase your chances of getting the clan
member back alive.

Free-Area: This mission involves fighting off a wave of enemies, setting up a
camp, and then fighting off rival clans. It's a lot of fun.

Encounter: A random battle mission in which you fight a rival clan.

-------------------
| CLAN LEVELS     |
-------------------
The Clan is basically the group of people with you during the game. They are
also the ones you can send out on these special dispatch and other missions
during the game. You may notice that after each battle, you get CP. This
stands for Clan Points. For every 100 AP, you gain a skill level in one of 8
areas.

These areas of level building are important, because they help you to complete
certain missions easier, as well as picking up rare items. Most missions
require you to be a certain Clan Level to even undergo the mission, so watch
out for those. The 8 levels are: Combat, Smithing, Appraise, Negotiation,
Magic, Craft, Collection, and Track.

Those should all be fairly obvious. Each of these skills help your clan out in
Free-Area and Dispatch missions. The higher your skill level, the easier of a
time the clan member will have, and the rarer the item he/she will bring back.
It is very important to keep your clan level high, so undergo as many battle
missions as you possibly can.

More on the other game basics will be coming soon, so stay tuned for that!

Here is the walkthrough for Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, which is the real
meat of the guide. I am going to do it mission by mission, with some storyline
information in between as I see fit. Enjoy!
---------

You will start off in a snowy schoolyard, where some bullies will be picking
on a little kid. Ritz will come in, and ask the kid to say his name. Once you
name the kid, the teacher begins a snowball fight.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Mission 000: Team Activity! Snowball Fight                                 |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| This fight is pretty simple, and is more about learning about the battle   |
| system than actually winning a challenging fight. Just move the characters |
| around, throwing snowballs and stuff. The battle is not hard because all   |
| of your opponents will just aim snowballs at Mewt, anyways. Once you get a |
| few good licks in, Marche will notice that there was a rock in a snowball, |
| and the teacher will quickly order the snowball fight to end.              |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mewt will thank Marche and Ritz for sticking up for him, and he invites the
two to come to the store to buy a new book with him. However, Marche has to
take a raincheck on it, because he wants to go talk to his brother at home
about the snowball fight. Mewt says that is okay and offers for the two to
come over later to read the new book, and the two agree.

You see, I already knew about the storyline of the game ahead of time, thanks
to people who like to give away story things that may seem minor but really
aren't, but I still think this scene was built up pretty well, especially for
a strategy game. Tactics was too complex with the war stuff, so this is a nice
change of pace.

So, the three of them decide to take a walk, and they walk past a café. They
see Mewt's father, who appears to be a little sad. Mewt explains that his
father has never been the same since Mewt's mother passed away a few years
ago. Marche goes home, and Ritz explains to Mewt that Marche has no father.
This was a pretty cool, yet sad scene.

At Marche's house, Marche explains to his brother what happened during the
snowball fight. Ritz and Marche meet up, and then you will see some
introductions. The four of them will now sit down to read the book, but they
can't read it. They talk about how cool it would be to be in a video game
world, and how the book seems kinda magical... okay, do you see where this is
going now? ^_^

Ritz and Mewt go home, and Marche falls asleep.. and suddenly the world turns
magical and he wakes up in this bizarre new world. He sees a bunch of animals,
and cries out "Lizard!" to a lizard, which offends the guy since he's a human
that looks like a lizard. A moogle shows up and defends Marche, saying that he
probably never saw a lizard-man before. All is forgiven, until the lizard sees
Marche is dressed like a soldier, and all hell breaks loose, causing a battle
to begin.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Mission 000: First Fight!                                                  |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Mission Objective: Defeat all enemies!                                     |
| Enemies: White Monk, Warrior                                               |
| Law: Item Ban (can't use Items at all)                                     |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| This battle is pretty straightforward and easy. The moogle will explain    |
| the judgment system before the battle starts. Just have Marche move behind |
| the White Monk and attack it, then the moogle will use a black magic spell |
| to kill the enemy. He'll then explain how JP works. Target the Warrior,    |
| and when it dies, it'll use a Potion, but since it's against the law, he's |
| off to jail. Battle is over, you win.                                      |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the battle, the moogle will offer you help. By the way, his name is
Montblanc, I just thought I'd point that out since he didn't come and try to
attack me. I only have the basic armor and weapons, you know. ^_^

Montblanc introduces you to his clan of moogles, and Marche decides to join
the clan for now. You will soon be on the world map, and you'll get a tutorial
about placing items on the world map to open towns. This is an idea that was
first employed in Legend of Mana, which is not really a bad game, but this
idea is pretty stupid in my opinion. Oh well, just a game. :)

Before you go any further, go to the menu now. You will see you have the
ability to switch between your clan members, but I advise not doing that right
now, as you don't really have any Gil to mess with. Instead, switch Marche's
secondary ability to Item, which will prove invaluable in upcoming boss
battles. Now, enter the town, go to the pub, accept the mission, which opens
Giza Plains up, and save your game.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Mission 001: Herb Picking                                                  |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Rank: 3     | Battle       | Price: 300 Gil    | Location: Giza Plains     |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Mission Objective: Defeat all enemies!                                     |
| Reward: 600 Gil, 40 AP                                                     |
| Enemies: Goblin x3, Red Cap, Sprite                                        |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Make sure to check the daily laws before entering the battle. If it is not |
| a good law, you can always walk around for a day or two and then check it  |
| again so it is more suitable. It is very important that you got a good law |
| going for you, as you don't have many abilities to work with here.         |
|                                                                            |
| The key to winning this battle is to keep the 2 mages away from the 5      |
| enemies. They are weak defensively, so have them stay away from the        |
| enemies, while Marche and the 2 warriors move towards the enemies and      |
| dispatch of them. Have the Archer stay behind and aim arrows towards the   |
| enemies, while the Black Mage uses black magic.                            |
|                                                                            |
| Black magic can be used to hit multiple enemies, by the way. This is a     |
| very important aspect of the battle system that will help you numerous     |
| times, so make sure to get the hang of it now. Also note that your players |
| will not be affected by the spell, so feel free to use the magic if they   |
| are in the way.                                                            |
|                                                                            |
| I would kill the Red Cap first, as it has a higher physical attack than    |
| the three Goblins. Take care of the Goblins next, and then focus on the    |
| Sprite, unless you can use black magic on it. The Sprite has a high evade, |
| unless you aim at it from the back.                                        |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Battle Tactics Learned: Black magic and evasion rates. You can use black magic
on multiple enemies at one time, and it won't affect your characters at all if
they are in the range as well. Evasion rates can be crucial, unless you aim
your attacks from behind the enemy. If you do that, then their evasion rates
will go way down.

After this battle, you will receive an item that lets you place a location
called Lutia Pass on the world map. Do so, then return to Cyril and select the
second mission - Thesis Hunting.

Before you undergo your mission, it's time to start placing jobs and abilities
on your characters. At this point in the game, Montblanc and Marche are your
two most important characters, as they will have to be in a lot of your
battles early on. Therefore, focus on them at first. I recommend having
Montblanc become a Fighter, while Marche becomes a thief.

Marche will eventually want to be a Soldier, Thief, and Fighter, but I prefer
having him be a Thief, first, since it would be easiest for him to train as
the weaker of the 3 job classes while the battles are still relatively easy.
Plus, the thief's abilities definitely come in handy in this game. "Steal" is
a very useful command that comes in handy later, so I recommend knocking that
job class off now, so make him a Thief.

Now, you can choose whether to do Mission 2 or not.. actually, I made you.
Haha. Follow my walkthrough, I choose to do the side missions later on.

This mission focuses on you having to recover a thesis that was stolen from
Coleman. This means going to Lutia Pass and encountering the bandits who stole
it, and then defeating them in order to recover it. Simple enough, so let's
go, shall we? Make sure to save before doing so.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Mission 002: Thesis Hunt                                                   |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Rank: 3     | Battle       | Price: 900 Gil    | Location: Lutia Pass      |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Mission Objective: Defeat all enemies!                                     |
| Reward: 4,000 Gil, 40 AP and Pure Staff                                    |
| Enemies: Soldier x2, Thief x2, Archer, White Mage                          |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Since Marche is a thief, his attack power will not be as high, but due to  |
| Montblanc's magic, it won't be too much of a problem. If you have a white  |
| mage, this battle will be pretty simple. It starts off with the bandits    |
| confronting you, and the battle begins, as you have to recover the stolen  |
| thesis from these guys.                                                    |
|                                                                            |
| Of course, if you take a look at your six enemies, you will notice a White |
| Mage on their team. Therefore, it is crucial that you go after him first.  |
| He starts off far away from you, so use ranged attack magic and move       |
| towards him with Marche. Marche may not be able to get him, though,        |
| because the white mage is a wuss and will keep running away from you.      |
| Fortunately, magic will eventually knock him out, preventing him from      |
| healing the opponents.                                                     |
|                                                                            |
| Now, you have a decision to make. Do you go after the soldiers, thieves,   |
| or archer? I say worry about the archer first, since he can stay far away  |
| from you and can prove to be pretty annoying. One of the thieves can       |
| counter your attacks, but fortunately they have yet to even master the     |
| Steal ability. Once you take care of those 3, finish off the soldiers and  |
| this battle is over. It's simple, so sorry I didn't describe how to kill   |
| them, but seriously, all you have to do is walk around and attack them     |
| until they die. It's really not that hard at all.                          |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the mission, Montblanc thinks you are ready to enter Clan Battles. This
accomplishes two things: One, you can now select "clan" on the menu, and fix
up your clan and check status on battles, etc. Two, you can now fight random
battles on the world map. This helps you gain experience and AP, and will come
in handy numerous times during the game.

I even recommend fighting once or twice right now. Make sure Marche gains at
least a few "Steal" abilities right away. I went ahead and gave him Steal EXP
and Steal Gil, since they only cost 100 AP each. Once you gain those two and
Steal Shield, you should be sick of random fighting, and will want to continue
the story, right? I'm with you on that, so let's see what we have to do next.

Place the next symbol on the world map. This opens up Nubswood. You can now
choose to do more missions, or complete the next one, which upgrades the
story. Note I don't have walkthroughs up for some of these missions right now,
so if you want to complete them, go for it. Doing so upgrades the weapons and
armor you find in towns. Here is some good stuff to look out for right now, if
you do some side missions.

White Monk: Kaiser Knuckles teach Air Render attack
White Mage: Bless Staff teaches Life spell.

When you are ready, select The Cheetahs and we are on our way!

This mission focuses on some con artists in Nubswood who are cheating people
out of their hard earned money, so it's time for them to serve hard time.
That's where you come into play, as your objective is to defeat them, so their
reign of conning people in Nubswood is finished.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Mission 003: The Cheetahs                                                  |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Rank: 3     | Battle       | Price: 1,200 Gil  | Location: Nubswood        |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Mission Objective: Defeat all enemies!                                     |
| Reward: 6,000 Gil, Atmos Blade, Fortune Ring, and 40 AP                    |
| Enemies: Black Mage, Thief, Archer, White Monk, Fighter                    |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| You'll only get four units this time out, so make sure to bring along a    |
| White Monk. Other then that, bring a White Mage, Black Mage, and Fighter.  |
| When the mission starts, Marche will see his friend Ritz (!) accompanying  |
| a stranger named Shara, chasing the fiends into the woods. Since those are |
| the same enemies you want to face, you and Ritz will team up for this      |
| battle.                                                                    |
|                                                                            |
| This mission will be VERY simple. Ritz and Shara move by themselves and do |
| their own thing, so don't worry about them. The White Monk is useful here, |
| especially since you got the Air Render attack (from the Kaiser Knuckles,  |
| right? I told you to do that!). Just make sure he's away from the enemies, |
| as it's a range-based attack, and will not do anything if the enemy is     |
| next to him.                                                               |
|                                                                            |
| The key to winning this battle is just to finish off the enemies that Ritz |
| and Shara attacked. The enemies will barely have a chance. The only one    |
| that may cause problems is the Black Mage, and perhaps the Archer, because |
| they both have long range attacks. If they hurt you, just have your White  |
| Mage come over and heal them. So, keep your white mage close to the        |
| characters at all time.                                                    |
|                                                                            |
| Hell, it's okay to keep all of your characters close to each other for     |
| this battle, since the enemies won't do much damage, and you'll basically  |
| be following Ritz and Shara's lead and finishing what they started. This   |
| is a very easy battle and you should have no problems with it at all. Have |
| Marche steal some EXP if you want, that's how easy this battle can be if   |
| you just follow these simple directions.                                   |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You will now have a scene with Marche and Ritz. The two old friends are
reunited, but they have completely different desires. Ritz doesn't want to
return to the old world, as she likes it here a lot in this new world. Marche
is a little homesick, though, and just wants to get home. The two decide to
part ways again, and a new place will open on the world map: Elut Sands.

Back in Cyril, Marche will be kind of depressed, and Montblanc will want to
know what's wrong. Marche says he's just thinking about the next mission. They
discuss things for a while, and Montblanc will end up comforting both Kupo and
Marche. Marche thought he knew a way to get Ritz and himself back to the real
world, but right now he is totally clueless as to how.

Fight the bottom missions (coming in a future update) if you wish, then choose
the top one to advance the story. Make sure everyone is around Level 6 or 7
before entering this one, as it's the toughest story battle yet.

This mission really doesn't have much background to it, it's just a battle out
in the desert plains with some wild animals. They've been causing some
problems out there, and your job is to eliminate them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Mission 004: Desert Peril                                                  |

| Reward: 7,000 Gil, Randomized Item, and 40 AP                              |
| Enemies: Red Panther x2, Couerl, Thunder Flan, Antlion                     |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Make sure to bring along a Black Mage, and if someone has the Aim ability, |
| bring them along too. This battle is relatively painless. The Thunder Flan |
| is your first concern, as it starts off closer to you. However, Montblanc  |
| (or your Black Mage) can just cast a spell other than Thunder on it, and   |
| it will go down quicker than Chris Rix in a first half of a big game. The  |
| Couerl is the only enemy you won't have to worry about right away, as it's |
| too far away to be a major issue at the moment.                            |
|                                                                            |
| Time to focus on the Red Panthers. If someone has the Aim ability, use it  |
| on the legs of the Antlion. Otherwise, have your physical attackers team   |
| up on the Red Panthers, while the White Mage follows them just in case     |
| they need curing. The Red Panthers physical attacks are a little stronger  |
| than you may expect. Have your black mage and Montblanc finish the Antlion |
| enemy off with Fire.                                                       |
|                                                                            |
| The Couerl will now be near you, but since most of the enemies are         |
| defeated, or close to it, it's no problem. Move your physical attackers    |
| over to the Couerl and finish it off, as your black mages finish the Red   |
| Panthers off with weak spells which don't do much damage (but won't have   |
| to), unless the Red Panthers were already killed.                          |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After this fight, Montblanc and Marche will wonder why the animals are
suddenly acting this way. They think it has something to do with the crystals,
and that's that. You now can place a new symbol on the map - ULIE RIVER.

If you still have Marche as a thief, you can make the decision to change him
to a Fighter or other job class now. It's up to you. I recommend keeping him
as a thief until you master the job, but you might want to get other abilities
now, and it does take a little while to master the job class.

Make sure to undertake all the missions you can possibly do here before moving
onto mission five - Twisted Flow.

In this mission, Marche finds himself in a dark room with a crystal, which
turns into a Totema summon!

| Deploying units in this battle is critical to your survival. Make sure to  |
| bring along the people with the Air Render attack (Should be White Monk    |

| attacks are very important for this challenging, but not impossible,       |

| This is your first taste of a boss fight. The boss comes with several      |

| want to. It's up to you.                                                   |

| are of medium strength, but sometimes they do this annoying Roulette       |
| attacks, which kills a character on the battlefield. This can also kill an |
| enemy or himself, so keep that in mind. The Floateyes are your basic       |
| enemies at this point, and won't be hard to kill if you choose to.         |
|                                                                            |
| However, your only objective is to beat Famrit, and it won't be too easy.  |
| You have 164 HP to knock off of him, and he has a very strong physical     |
| attack rate. Also, he counters attacks you do from up close, which is why  |
| I recommended bringing in all long-range attackers. Fire away with an      |
| Archer's charge attack, Black magic, and Air Render attacks in order to    |
| put him away. Make sure to keep the White Mage healing people at all       |
| times, that's what he is there for.                                        |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You will now encounter another scene. Marche will be interested as to why
Famrit guarded the crystals, and Famrit will explain that the moogles and
totemas are connected by the crystals, and have formed a power. The moogles
are known as "the white ones" to the totemas. Famrit now lends his power to
Marche, and the crystal breaks. When it does, Mewt shows up in an image and
says that the world will change if all the crystals break.

Mewt is now with his father Cid (haha, they found a way to sneak Cid in this
one, too), and he's explaining to his dad about the schoolyard fight, and the
rock in the snowball, but his dad doesn't have any idea what he's talking
about. Worried, Mewt gets frustrated, and then finds out some startling news.

In the old world, Mewt's mother passed away, remember? In this world, she's
alive, and is the Queen of Ivalice! Cid happens to be the man that makes all
the laws now, and Mewt is the Prince of Ivalice. How the hell did this happen,
and what is going on here now?

Marche now wants to go home, and he knows the only way he's going to do that
is if he destroys all the crystal, You'll now get Cadonan to place on your
world map, so do so and then enter. Two people will be talking about how they
want the laws strengthened, and then they will approach Marche and say that
laws will soon be nonexistent. After this scene, save and enter Cadonan for a
mission.

Here in Cadonan, Marche will see the man he saw earlier, then the man will be
ganged up on by a group of people who tell him that he can't run forever. It
turns out this man's name is Ezel, and it's your mission to save him. At the
select screen, you only get 5 choices.. so choose a white mage, black mage,
archer, and two physical attackers. Let's begin!

| Enemies: Gladiator, Illusionist, Hunter, Ninja, Fighter, Defender          |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| This is not a tough battle all in all. The only problem you will really    |
| have is the fact that you start at the bottom of the hill, but soon you    |
| will not have too much of a problem with that. Have your physical fighters |
| get rid of the Illusionist, Ninja, Fighter, and Defender, while Marche and |
| the Mages focus on the others. Also, use the Archer to stay at the bottom  |
| of the hill, and use his long distance attacks to your advantage.          |
|                                                                            |
| If you want an even easier time, have Montblanc clear out one side of      |
| enemies, while Marche summons Famrit on his turn. Due to the high power of |
| this summon, it will easily knock out multiple enemies, and will really    |
| make this battle a breeze.                                                 |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There, that wasn't so bad. After the fight, Ezel will tell Marche that he has
to run away because some mean people are chasing him. A group led by Mewt's
father will approach the two boys suddenly and start speaking to Ezel. Much to
Marche's surprise, it turns out that Mewt's father is none other than the
Judgemaster. Wow, what a shocking plot twist!!!!one!

He will then ask Ezel to come along so they can discuss the Antilaws. Then
suddenly he pulls out a card, which completely envelops Ezel! Ezel says that
only the judgemaster is allowed to use such an advanced card, and then he
pulls out an antilaw card. He uses this card to help him and Marche escape,
than Mewt's father (named Cid) will be shocked that Ezel learned an antilaw
card so quickly.

Back at the pub, Ezel and Marche are having a chat about the antilaw cards.
Ezel will talk about his store, which carries all sorts of law cards. Alright,
back on the map, a new place named Aisenfield is available, so open it up and
then go there.

Choose the Diamond Rain mission, and we are ready to roll. Here are the jobs I
recommend you bring along this time out. Archer, Dragoon, Fighter, 2 Thieves,
Black Mage, and White Mage. This will give you a well-balanced team. Have one
Thief bring Steal Armor, while the other equips another Steal ability. Fighter
should have Air Render. Let's begin.

| Enemies: Icedrake x2, Ice Flan, Lamia, Bomb                                |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| The key to winning this battle is to keep your party members separated at  |
| all times. Don't bunch all together, as the Ice Flan has a devastating Ice |
| Breath attack that will do damage to all party members in the range of the |
| attack. It's best to let just one or two people get hit by it, and not five|
| or six. Since most of the creatures here are weak against Fire, exploit    |
| that weakness by casting Fire magic on the Ice enemies.                    |
|                                                                            |
| Besides that, have your non-magic users focus on the Lamia and Bomb. These |
| enemies are not terribly tough, but Bomb will blow up, as is typical in    |
| these Final Fantasy games, if you do not kill him in time. Just have a     |
| Fighter attack one, while a Dragoon jumps another one. The Archer can stay |
| behind and pick off the rest. Easy.                                        |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Marche was hoping the Diamonds were crystals, but they are unfortunately not.
There's not much to do now, so use the Volcano Symbol to open up a new town
and enter. Make sure a Moogle is able to summon Famrit before entering the
next story-based mission. Make sure to upgrade your equipment, too.

The party I recommend for this next mission is Black Mage, Dragoon, Summoner,
and Dragoon. Have the Summoner be able to summon Ramuh, while the Black Mage
has level 2 magic. If you don't have all of these abilities yet, do some side-
quests first. I recommend doing them, anyways. Once you have completed them,
save your game and choose Hot Awakening. Prepare yourself.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| There are several ways to do this battle, but I have found a pretty easy   |
| way that doesn't take too long. The Crystals never move, but they do a     |
| range attack called Logos, which attacks everyone within a certain amount  |
| of space around the Crystal. Therefore, have your Summoners and Moogles    |
| stay back, and have them summon Ifrit and Ramuh, if they have the 10 JP    |
| necessary. This should easily take out a few of the crystals.              |
|                                                                            |
| You should be down to 3 or 4 crystals, so have the Black Mage prepare level|
| 2 spells while a Dragoon jumps. This will take out 1 crystal, and will     |
| prevent damage to both characters (provided the Black Mage is out of the   |
| crystal's way). Have the rest of the party gang up on the other crystals   |
| until they are defeated. You shouldn't even have to heal.                  |
|                                                                            |
| Now, what if your top 2 people, or person, can't summon thanks to a lack of|
| JP? If neither can, this battle will be a little bit trickier. Have the    |
| Black Mage do a lot of level 2 magic. Him and the Dragoon will be very     |
| important in this battle, as they both can do attacks that prevent them    |
| from getting hit. You can keep doing this over and over until all 8 are    |
| dead, without getting hit, or you can have everyone join in the fun.       |
|                                                                            |
| The easiest way to do this battle is to time the turns of the Crystals and |
| then do attacks in timing with their attacks. Have 3 people with ranged    |
| attacks go to the left crystal and take it out with attacks, then push L   |
| to look at the turn order. Have all 4 units wait until the next crystal    |
| gets its turn. It will attack, but it won't hit any of your characters.    |
| Move all of them to this crystal, and then kill it before it does its      |
| attack. Have them wait again, and rinse and repeat the process over and    |
| over. That is the easiest and safest way to win this fight.                |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Marche will wonder if those crystals were connected to a race like the Famrit
was. Well, it's a good thought. A crystal will break, and then Mewt will
appear, telling Marche to stop making him remember and to get out of this
world. Marche is transported back to Roda Volcano, and Marche will wonder if
Ivalice is really Mewt's dream world.

Preparing for the next mission is pretty simple. Have a Moogle learn two Thief
skills, if he hasn't already. This allows him to change into the Gadgeteer
class, so do that and equip him with Dream Claws. Also, have 2 people with
Thief abilities equipped, Steal Armor and Steal Helmet. The next battle is a
great opportunity to steal a lot of good equipment. However, the thieves there
also can steal stuff from you, so you may want to take your best stuff off if
needed.

Now, do some side missions if you want, and prepare for the next mission. Here
is the party I recommend. Fighter/Air Render. Summoner/Ramuh/Sleep.
Thief/Steal Armor. Gadgeeteer/Steal Helmet. White Mage/Cura. Let's begin.

| Enemies: Archer, Black Mage, Summoner, Thief x2, Sniper, Time Mage         |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| This is when things really start to get interesting. As you see here, the  |
| big concern are the 2 Thieves, as they have the ability to steal things    |
| from you. The Archer, Black Mage, and Time Mage will run away from you,    |
| as they can cast ranged magic. This will make them hard to kill, and is why|
| I recommended bringing along the Summoner (make sure he knows the Red Mage |
| spell of "Sleep" before bringing him along). The Sniper will stay away,    |
| too, making this an interesting battle to win.                             |
|                                                                            |
| Make sure to try to have someone learn Maintenance soon, as it stops the   |
| incoming Thievery attacks. You won't really have to worry about them here, |
| as have the Summoner cast Sleep. This should send all the enemies to sleep.|
| Have your Thieves steal equipment from their Thieves, then have your       |
| Fighter do Air Render. Now, the rest of the enemies should be awake. They  |
| won't be too happy and will do some damage.                                |
|                                                                            |
| Have the White Mage cast Cura, then have the Summoner cast Sleep again. If |
| he has 10 JP, have him cast Ramuh the next turn. Otherwise, just keep      |
| killing one enemy at a time, putting them to sleep, while the White Mage   |
| heals as needed. Preparation is good.                                      |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A judge will be all pissed and will sentence them all to jail, but Marche will
just leave. Place to Salikawood symbol on the world map and enter. Here, buy
new armor. The next battle is a boss battle, so it will be tougher than
normal. Did you learn Maintenance yet? If not, try to in the side missions
here.

Also, have an Animist in your party learn Sleep Count. Combined with the
Summoner's Sleep ability, the next mission will be pretty easy. Have Two
Thieves with Steal Armor/Steal Helm again, while a White Monk with Air Render
or Far Fist works best as well. Hopefully your Summoner is able to summon
Kirin by now, too. Try to learn skills for all these jobs in the side
missions, then save and accept the mission.

Need help on stuff after the ninth mission? Don't worry, I'll have that and
more for you tomorrow.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Right now I do recommend having a White Monk, White Mage, Black Mage, and  |
| Marche should definitely be a Thief, so he can learn some of their skills. |
| This battle won't really be that tough. Have the physical attackers move   |
| in front of the magic users to shield them from any harm. The White Monk   |
| is closest to you, and will also be the one easiest to kill. Surround it   |
| and kill it with physical attacks.                                         |
|                                                                            |
| The White Mage and Soldier are next. Have the Black Mage hit the White     |
| Mage with magic, while the rest of your characters kill the Soldier. Then, |
| spread your characters out so Dolce can't kill them all at once, and then  |
| take turns pounding away on him until he dies. This is not really hard to  |
| do all in all, and should only take a few minutes at most.                 |

| Enemies: Mog Knight, Time Mage, Juggler, Thief, White Monk, Warrior        |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| This is a pretty easy battle to win. Most of the enemies here know only    |
| time magic, like spells which increase their speed. Basically, nothing you |
| really have to worry about. The only enemy you have to kill is the Mog     |
| Knight, but I do recommend killing the rest of the enemies as you will get |
| additional experience points and AP for doing so. The Warrior and White    |
| Monk should be killed first, as they are the most powerful. Have Marche    |
| be a high-powered job class and use physical attacks, along with other     |
| physical attackers.                                                        |
|                                                                            |
| While the physical attackers focus on the powerful adversaries, have your  |
| mages focus their magic on the Time Mage, Juggler, and then Thief, if      |
| necessary (the attackers may have moved onto the Thief by now.) Once they  |
| are all defeated, all that's left is the Mog Knight. All it really does is |
| weak physical attacks and Last Haste, a spell which increases the entire   |
| enemy party's speed, BUT THEY'RE ALL DEAD ANYWAYS. :P So, he won't be much |
| of a problem at all.                                                       |

| The party I recommend right now is White Mage, Black Mage, 2 Archers, and  |
| 2 Fighters. This will give you a well rounded party right now, although    |
| you may want to make Marche a Thief so he can learn some important steal   |
| abilities that will come in handy for an upcoming boss mission. There are  |
| five enemies here, all are job classes, and all will be somewhat difficult |
| to defeat. Dragoons are hardest, because they will do Jump sometimes,      |
| making them harder to kill. The Archer is also annoying, and you should    |
| immediately send your Black Mage after him.                                |
|                                                                            |
| The enemies here will hit you hard, which is why I recommended bringing    |
| along a White Mage. His cure magic will prove to be invaluable for this    |
| fight. While your Black Mage is focusing on the Archer, have the 2 Archers |
| go after the Alchemist. Once the Alchemist is done, the mission is over.   |
| You can have the 2 Fighters (or Fighter and Thief, whatever you decided    |
| on) go after the Gladiator, Thief, and Dragoon while you are waiting for   |
| the Archers to finish off the Alchemist if you want.                       |

| Reward: 30 AP, 30 CP, Random Items                                         |
| Enemies: Goblin, Icedrake, Malboro, Bomb, Firewyrm                         |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| The battle field for this area is pretty unique.. you're at the top of a   |
| huge hill, and enemies are scattered around the hill. You'll want to move  |
| fast and keep up with them before they start to corner your characters.    |
| There are 3 weak enemies in this battle: Goblin, Icedrake, and Bomb. Bomb  |
| knows a very weak breath attack, as does the Icedrake. These attacks are   |
| not that strong and only affect people in a certain distance anyways. Take |
| care of those three enemies first. Have an Archer planted on top of the    |
| hill so he can easily take out one enemy, while your physical attackers    |
| get rid of the other 2.                                                    |
|                                                                            |
| The Malboro is something that is infamous for being an annoying creature   |
| in mostly every recent Final Fantasy game. It has the Bad Breath attack    |
| still, so bring along a White Mage (with Esuna) just in case. Have an      |
| Archer and Black Mage take care of it from afar so the breath attack won't |
| hit them. The Firewyrm is sort of like the Icedrake, but the Fire Breath   |
| attack is a little bit more harmful. Fortunately, you won't sustain that   |
| much damage, if you even get hit by the attack. It's a spread ranged       |
| attack, so chances are if you are far enough you won't ever get hit by its |
| attack to begin with.                                                      |

| Enemies: Fencer, Fighter, Dragoon, Archer x2                               |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| This is not a challenging battle at all. It's like a regular clan battle.  |
| The Archers are pretty annoying and I'd probably worry about taking them   |
| out, although it's a little annoying to do so without a lot of long range  |
| characters, as Archers have a habit of running into a corner and firing    |
| their little bows at you. The Fighter and Dragoon are as decently          |
| challenging as always, but not impossible. I'd focus on the Dragoon first. |
| The Fencer knows the Nighthawk move, so get rid of him as well.            |
|                                                                            |
| I'd bring along some long range characters to get rid of the Archers,      |
| especially the Viera one. Get your strong physical attackers to get rid of |
| the powerful Fighter, then worry about the Dragoon and finally the Fencer. |
| The Fencer only uses Nighthawk sometimes and it's not the most dangerous   |
| attack in the world. As long as you take out the Archers and Fighter as    |
| soon as you can, you really won't struggle through this battle much at     |
| all, more than likely.                                                     |

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| White Mage, Black Mage, Archer, Summoner, Fighter, and White Monk is my    |
| recommended party for this mission. There's only five enemies in this      |
| mission, and despite the fact one of them proves to be a little bit tricky |
| if you are not careful, you will overall have a pretty easy time with this |
| one. The enemy to worry about is one of the Antlions named Ludora. It has  |
| counter-attacking abilities, so have your archer and black mage take it    |
| out, while the Fighter and White Monk lay waste to the rest of the enemies |
| on the battlefield.                                                        |

| The Summoner is getting kinda lonely, eh? Just be building its JP up, as   |
| you will need it for an upcoming boss mission. Your five characters should |
| be more than enough for the five enemies to handle, and so this battle     |
| will prove to be nothing more than a walk in the park. Just make sure not  |

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| One of the easier missions in the game, as all you have to do is kill 4    |
| bombs, and they are not exactly the toughest enemies in the game. Make     |
| sure to bring along a Black Mage so he can cast Blizzard magic. This will  |
| prove to be invaluable. Also, make sure not to form a circle around a Bomb,|
| as it can do this blaze attack that hits everyone in the circle for 40+ HP.|
| As long as you remember these basic things, you will be fine. Blizzard     |
| works best, of course, but physical attacks are fine as well.              |

| Mission Objective: Defeat all enemies!                                     |
| Reward: 11,400 Gil, Tonberrian, 40 AP, 30 CP                               |
| Enemies: Tonberry x2, Masterberry                                          |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| This mission is somewhat tough, but since you are able to bring in six     |
| units against their three, it should prove to be a little bit easier than  |
| you may expect. Never underestimate the Tonberries, though. Those of you   |
| that are veterans of the Final Fantasy series knows it has a nasty attack, |
| referred to as "Karma" in this game, which does 999 damage to your unit.   |
| Therefore, make sure to have a good strategy entering this battle.         |
|                                                                            |
| Each of these enemies knows the Knife attack, which reduces someone's HP   |
| by 90 percent. Be careful to not get hit by that too much, but fortunately |
| this attack can never kill you. Its physical attacks can, though. The      |
| battle area is basically a town with houses and stuff, the Tonberries are  |
| spread out, so have two units go after each one. It doesn't really matter  |
| what classes you use here, as long as you have effective long-range and    |
| some healers. Archer and Chemists are kinda useful here, as are strong     |
| physical attackers.                                                        |

SECTFAQS
--------
Here is a list of questions I saw floating around the internet that were asked
a lot. If you have any more, feel free to ask.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Is this game like Final Fantasy Tactics?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A: Sort of. The battles work the same way, and the jobs system is still here,
but there are tons of differences. The abilities system changed, the storyline
is all new, and overall it feels like a completely different game.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Should I get this or Disgaea?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A: I'd personally get Disgaea, since I feel this game has too many flaws (I
don't like the new judgment system, or the new abilities system), but you
can't really go wrong with either game, and I am glad I got both.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Is Cloud really in this game?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A: No, unlike FFT, Cloud is not in this game.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. How do I start a free area mission?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A: You basically have to do what it tells you to do. If it tells you the
dispatch needs three battles, you fight three battles. If it has days, you
walk around for the number of days it tells you to.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Are there random battles?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A: The only random battles you will see are the people that walk around on the
world map. Those are the only "random battles" in this entire game.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Can you walk around in towns this time?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A: No, you can't. You still get the same old options, pub, shop, etc. You can
only control your characters on the world map, and even then it's just to walk
from one spot to the next.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. What's the maximum amount of JP I can have?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A: You can have up to 10 JP at one time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. Do enemies level up as you do?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A: Yes, they do. They probably won't be at the exact same level, but you will
notice their levels will increase as yours do. Note that some story based
enemies won't level up as you do, as they have a set level.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. How does the mission system work?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A: When you go to a pub in a town, you get to select from several missions.
Only one of them is a story based mission, the rest are optional, but allow
you to pick up AP and EXP, as well as items you sometimes can't find anywhere
else.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10. How much JP do you need to summon Totema?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A: You need 10 JP to summon a Totema.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11. What statistic increases the stealing rate?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Thanks to Terence from GameFAQs FFTA board for this helpful answer!)
A: No stat determines the success rate of stealing. The only things that
determine accuracy (including steal accuracy) are:

Ability Type (Attack, Status, or 100% Hit)
Ability Bonuses (2x, 1x, 0.5x, 0.25x; Steal: Weapon is a 1x, Steal: Ability is
a 0.25x)
Target's Evade (or Status Evade for Status Type attacks)
Which side of the unit you're attacking
Support Abilities (like Concentrate or Turbo MP)
Statuses (like Blind)
...and in the case of Steal itself, the Thief Armlet accessory.

Your units level and stats do *not* affect this one bit. To increase your
success in stealing, you are recommended to always steal from behind your
opponents, have Concentrate set as your Support ability, and have Thief
Armlets equipped.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12. There's multiplayer?!?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A: There sure is, but it's only co-op, so don't be expecting to kick ass.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13. Can you change character names?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A: Only the main character's. You're forced to keep the rest.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14. Will the random clan battles be hard on level 50?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A: No. You'll be stronger and have far more abilities. You'll be fine.

Final Fantasy Tactics Advance has a lot of items, weapons, etc. to keep track
of, so here is a list of all the important things you will get in the game.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
| SECTSIX1 | ---------------------------------------------------- [ 6.1 JOBS ]
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Jobs are the most important aspect of Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. Each job 
has different statistic, which I list in their section. Everything is 
affected, from how many spaces the character can move, to how fast they react 
and act during battle. It's important to choose job classes that fit your 
style. If you hate slow characters, use faster ones. Stuff like that makes the 
game a whole lot more fun.

Each job also helps you learn abilities. For instance, thieves earn you 
abilities like Steal: EXP, which help you steal experience points from 
enemies. Each job class has individual abilities, so if you find a job class 
with abilities you like, you may want to stick with that job class for a 
while.

There are several different races, as you may know. Each races come with their 
own job classes, so I split the job classes into their own sections.

For the abilities learned list, you will see name, AP, item, and description. 
Name is the name of course, AP is how much AP you need to learn it, and Item 
is the item that teaches the ability.

Finally, sometimes you need to master/learn an ability of a previous job in 
order to unlock a new job. If this is needed, I will mention it in the 
section. Without further adieu, here's the job listing of Final Fantasy 
Tactics Advance.

-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
You should probably know the deal with Archers by now. They have somewhat weak 
attack power, but their main advantage comes from the fact that they fire 
arrows from long distance, making them a good class to hide away from the 
enemies. Against enemies that use solely short-ranged attacks, Archers could 
be a real lifesaver. Concentrate is its best ability you can learn, as it lets 
you focus all your energy, increasing statistics dramatically for the duration 
of the battle. Aim helps you aim for various body parts, which come in handy 
when enemies are wearing armor.

-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
I like the Soldier class to a certain extent. They aren't magic users at all, 
but First Aid is a surprisingly useful healing ability considering the fact 
that they are mostly physical attackers. I do like their strong attack power 
and their decent move range. Some of the most useful abilities that the 
Soldier possesses are the aforementioned First Aid, as well as the various 
Break attacks, like Powerbreak and Mindbreak, which significantly decrease 
your enemy's statistics. I like using them early on. I compare them to the 
Warrior class in Final Fantasy X-2: Good early, useless later.

Abilities are a lot of fun to learn. In this game, each job gives you 
abilities which you can learn. In this section, I list the name of the 
ability, what class learns the ability, the type of ability it is, how much AP 
it costs to learn, what item lets you learn it, and what the ability does. 
Fun, huh?

How do you learn abilities? Simple. Find the ability you want to learn, and 
equip the job class and item needed. Now, learn the required AP, and voila, 
the ability is free for you to use at any time.

There are four types of abilities: action, reaction, support, and combo. 
Action are physical attack skills that help you attack enemies. Reaction are 
defensive skills, support help your statistics, and combo abilities give you 
combos to use.

Here is where I end the guide by spewing off a bunch of random stuff, but the
credits are very important to me.

| THANKSTO | ------------------------------------------------- [ 7.1 CREDITS ]
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

I'd just like to thank the following people for their support:

- Cassey Blankenship "my boo": My soon to be fiancé, my soulmate, my
everything. My life would be nothing without her, and I don't think I would be
able to complete this guide if it wasn't for her love and support. She is
everything I want in a woman, and her support means everything to me. I
dedicate this guide to her, because she is the one that willed me to do it.
Thank you babe, and I love you so much. (She also got me off my ass to update
this, so cheers to her :-)

- The group of friends I made on GameFAQs: Thanks to you guys for supporting
me when things got tough, and you know I always got you back. This guide could
also not be possible without Dan Gordon and Deflux, so big ups to you guys for
motivating me to get my ass into gear.

- winnie the poop, for telling me some crap about the game basics that I
completely forgot and probably would have ignored anyways. <3

- Job class guide at GameFAQs for a little bit of help with jobs and 
abilities.

- Dark Vortex's amazing guide for motivation. Yami's crappy guide for 
motivation as well. (Oh, and Dark Vortex helped me with some weapon stats 
inadvertently, so thanks dude *thumbs up*)

- KoopaKid, for the cool ASCII art because I suck ass at making them.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

You can check out all of my other guides on GameFAQs, which will hopefully
include a very sexy Legend of Legaia: Duel Saga guide soon. I can't wait to
finish that thing. I am most proud of this guide and Legend of Legaia, but I
did guides for a lot of Final Fantasies, as well as some random Castlevania
and wrestling games, and both Tales of Destiny games. Check them out!

In addition on my quest to write for all the Final Fantasy games, I will try
to finish my Aria of Sorrow and Duel Saga guides, as well as some random NES
games (Predator, NOES, Jeopardy Jr., and Puss and Boots, anyone?) and guides
for the other 2 Castlevania games that employ the new style. Oh, and I might
do a Wild Arms 3 guide. And a Grandia guide with my sexy Cyril. Stay tuned,
kids.

And there's always Final Fantasy X-2 to look forward to...

I appreciate any information you can contribute, especially to jobs and
abilities list, as well as stuff I missed, walkthrough, etc. Anything can
help.

Also, feel free to email any questions that would be good for a FAQ section,
as I plan to add one to a future update.

Any errors and omissions that you may see can be corrected if you inform me of
them. I'll also credit you, if your error or omission is actually correct and
worth an update for me to fix. I am somewhat busy, you know.

That's about it. If anyone would like me to add anything, you can always email
me.

AIM: JuanDixonFor3
MSN: mcfa4834@bellsouth.net
YIM: nicklacheysnightmare

If you contact me on one of the instant messengers, and I do not respond, it
probably means I am busy. I am always talking with my girl, and friends, so
sometimes I just ignore some instant messages from people I do not know. Be
nice, and I will talk to you, just don't come out and ask the question and be
all rude if I do not respond in five seconds, otherwise I probably will just
block you. I will answer all e-mails about the game, however.

You can contact me by emailing me at mcfaddenvg@#yahoo.com

One last note: Only email me about the game at mcfaddenvg@yahoo.com, all
emails about Final Fantasy Tactics Advance sent to my other e-mail addresses
will be deleted and/or ignored. Thanks to all those that have emailed me so
far, I appreciate it!

1. Check my email backlog. If it's filled up, you may have to wait a while
before you get a response.

2. I check my email once in a while. Please wait for a response, because I
will respond to all emails.

3. Please read my guide before asking questions, thats why I have a FAQ and
Reader Tips section.

4. I will only post your question/tip in my guide if it is good, and has not
been answered in this guide.

Also, I have AIM and Yahoo. My AIM name is JuanDixonFor3, but PLEASE do not
harass me with annoying questions or I'll block you. I only wish to chat with
people.

I hope you all enjoyed my first attempt at a strategy game guide. It's not
perfect, but it's the best I can do, and I appreciate any support and advice
