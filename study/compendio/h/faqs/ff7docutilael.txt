Introduction			Int
==================================

	Hi, my name is Mark and my screen name is Utilael.  I am the 
creator of this guide.

What this guide is:
	Hey, this FAQ was made to help anyone with the Extra Missions. 
Whether your stuck, need to find the best way to get something done, or 
wondering where a capsule is on a level, this guide will help you.  
This guide will have expected you to have gone through the main story 
line at least once on normal, but don't worry though, I'll explain 
everything, even stuff that would only confuse someone who hasn't 
touched the game.

What this guide is not:
	This FAQ was not made to help people through any part of the main 
storyline, on any difficulty, for anything.  This guide was not made to 
help you on the tutorial that you can get to at the main screen (why in 
the world would you need help on a tutorial?).  This guide was also not 
created to help you learn how to play the game, go to the tutorial and 
play through it if you want to do that.  Please do not email me 
concerning any of these subjects.

==================================
About the FAQ			AtF
==================================

	This FAQ will help you through any aspect of the Extra Missions 
in the Extra Features of the Square Enix game, Final Fantasy: Dirge of 
Cerberus.  I will make sure to explain all that I can step by step, 
but, due to how hard it can be to use the map, and the different things 
that can happen if you choose to follow the guide step by step, it will 
be hard to simply just begin using a guide on a level when you are half 
way through, so do yourself a favor, and start from the beginning when 
you use a guide for a level.
	These guides will help you through a level, but no guarantees.  I 
would recommend only using this guide when you get stuck and have tried 
to get through a level a few times, but nevertheless, the choice of how 
to use this guide is up to you.  I will sometimes use the map to tell 
you where things are, or give a direction based on the maps definition 
of north, but if I use either of those two to tell you where to go, I 
will always give you a relative way to get there also (e.g. Head to the 
north (to the right of where you start) through the door.).

Here is an example of a mission guide:

==================================

This is a rather easy map, that is hard to get through at first, but 
after a few tries on your own, you'll wonder why it was so hard the 
first time... Or you can just follow this guide.

	Now, E-13 is the location of the first cardkey you need to get to 
the second part of the level.  But however, when you start out, there 
is a red gate keeping you from getting there, so your going to have to 
take the long way.  From your starting position, to the left is a dog 
and a deepground SOLDIER Class Robot that will jump off the ledge and 
attack, immediately after that, another SOLDIER Class Robot (which I'll 
call ninja's from now on), will come at you from your right, kill him, 
grab the EX File (1) in the cargo, and go through the arch in which he 
came from (after going through this part a few times, I realized that 
it is often that all of these men may take different paths then what 
I've specified here, so be ready for anything to happen, but you need 
only expect three enemies).
	Once through the tunnel, destroy the second cargo with EX File 
(2) in it, and kill the deepground soldier that is standing on a ledge 
to the left.  Go towards the ledge that the soldier was just on, and on 
your right will be another soldier, kill him, but continue running 
towards the explosive barrel in the NW.  Another soldier will be 
standing on a ledge right next to an explosive barrel, destroy the 
barrel for an instant kill, or just kill the soldier, then turn to your 
left and run southwards through the arches until you reach a building, 
there may also be another soldier on a ledge, depending on which arch 
you went under.
	After reaching the building, go inside and grab the cardkey (this 
is E-13 by the way).  Head back out and go left, so your heading in a 
NNW direction.  Once you reach the wall, run up to the gate and use the 
cardkey you just got to get through.  There is a possibility, if you 
didn't kill everyone on your way to the cardkey that, once you make it 
up, you'll be shot at, so pull out a sniper and shoot back if this 
happens.  Continue heading north and, if you so wish, kill the two 
snipers on the roofs, and the third sniper behind a gate to the east.  
Then continue north until you come to the wall, then head east towards 
the large pit in the ground.  Carefully look over the edge and snipe 
the two soldiers at the bottom of the pit.  Then jump down and either 
pull out your machine gun, or start meleeing the little Red Saucer 
robots that will begin to attack.  Once your finished, head east and 
turn around the corner on your right and kill the soldier, then turn 
around and head north into the building immediately in front of you,
step into the blue circle and your done!

Mission 2 - Widow Missileer

Defeat:     KO
Time Limit: None
Goal Point: N/A

	Rifle Bullets: 60
	Handgun Bullets: 180
	Machine Gun Bullets: 300

My Best Time: 0:09

==================================

This is a very simple mission, just kill the Black Widow Squad.

	All you need to do on this level is either run back and forth 
dodging the missiles and taking shots at on of the Black Widows, or 
simply run to the right of your starting position and pick up an ether 
(or run to the front of the right most barrel and pick up magic there) 
and take two or three fire magic shots at them and destroy them all.  
But either way, once you kill but one of these machines, you kill them 
all.

Defeat:     KO
Time Limit: None

	Handgun Bullets: 180
	Machine Gun Bullets: 300

My Best Time: 7:12

==================================
This is actually, quite an easy mission, however, the only reason I'd 
give this a 3/5 difficulty is due to how long it takes to kill Dual 
Horn and the annoying hounds that'll attack you constantly while your 
at it.

	Start out by running north, taking out all hounds on the way, 
you'll have one large group come at first, then they come about one to 
three at a time, and keep coming that way.  There are some Cactuars up 
in the NE area of the map that will drop Limit Breaks, and all the 
hounds may drop some kind of item or ammo when you kill them.  I find 
that also, you hurt Dual Horn more if he is not facing you, so try to 
get to his back side if you can.  A very easy way to beat Dual Horn 
(thanks to sephirosuy for the idea) is to get 3 limit breaks from the 
Cactuars, then run over to a trench and jump over, and continue doing 
this back and forth until Dual Horn falls in, then just start unloading 
on him and using you limit breaks until he either dies, or gets out.  
If he gets out, just start jumping across the trench until he falls 
back in again.  Once you've finished him off, you done!

==================================

Mission 4 - Vincent the Mage

Mission:    Defeat 100 Enemies Using Only Magic
Defeat:     KO
Time Limit: None
Goal Point: N/A

Difficulty: 2/5

Capsule: On a roof.
	Sound Gallery; Battlefields
	Location: C-12
	How to Destroy: Materia Shot

Starting...
	Health: 780/780
	Magic: 0
	Rifle Bullets: 0
	Handgun Bullets: 0
	Machine Gun Bullets: 0

My Best Time: 11:50

==================================

This is also a rather easy mission, however, due to the fact that 
getting magic can be quite a hassle, this mission is a bit more 
difficult.

	Start out by grabbing the ether and using it to get yourself some 
magic, then start unloading on the hounds (if you need some materia, 
there's all Blizzard, Thunder, and Fire all on the broken bridge across 
from where you start),  the best way to kill these guys is to do it in 
groups, as one shot can take out a lot of hounds if they're close 
together.  The hounds will also drop a lot of Red Ethers, which can be 
very helpful, so target these guys often.  Once you start moving 
around, more guys start to appear, such as Dual Horns, Ninja's, and 
flying Deepground Soldiers.  When a soldier appears, make it your top 
priority until you kill it, because they have long range, have Dual 
Horns be your second top priority, as they are annoying and painful.  
Everything else is up to you really, there are items scattered all 
throughout the level, and they do respawn after a while, so don't be 
rushed, take your time and kill everyone one by one.

	Machine Gun Bullets: 140

My Best Time: 12:03

==================================

This mission took me forever to figure out how to beat, but it is in 
fact, one of the easier missions in the game and I'll tell you step by 
step how I beat it.

Room 1: Weak Deepground Soldier x3
	I started off by just running out with my rifle and giving one 
hit kills to all three men in the room, it is also just as easy to use 
a handgun and take them out the same way.

Room 2: Deepground Soldier x4
	These soldiers will take a lot more hits to kill than the 
previous ones, probably about two hits from a handgun.  So what I did 
was I ran into the room until the soldiers came out, then I back 
peddled back into the hall and headshotted each soldier one by one, 
nice and easy.

Room 3: Elite Ninja x3
	All you need to do on this one is pull out your rifle, zoom in on 
the block at the end of the hall, and walk foreword until the ninja's 
come out, then if you headshot them, it should only take two hits each. 
You can also use your handgun just as easily here, just once the 
ninja's are about to reach you, jump over them shoot them as you back 
peddle.

Room 4: Deepground Soldier x7
	This is a very easy room, but if you don't know the secret, it's 
one of the most painful.  All you need to do is pull out a handgun and 
shoot the barrel that's sitting on a ledge above the seven soldiers, 
and blam, their all dead.

Room 5: Red Saucer x20
	There's two easy ways to defeat this area, either pull out your 
machine gun, run towards the machines and start unloading, then once 
they start coming towards you, make your way back into the red keycard 
room to your right and shoot any machine that comes in until they're 
all dead.  Or you an just run into the middle of the machines and start 
meleeing your way through them until you win.  The latter choice will 
probably get you hurt a bit more than the first choice, so I would 
choose depending on your health.

Room 6: Deepground Soldier x3, Bull Head x2, Elite Soldier x1
	The Elite Soldier won't come into the battle until you come near 
the second room, so wait until you've finished off the other enemies 
before going that way.  Start by either finishing off the Bull Heads 
with one to two rounds of melee attacks, or begin by just killing of 
the soldiers, or do both at the same time, depending on which is more 
of a threat.  Then once all five are finished off, head towards the 
second room and kill the Elite Soldier and your done!, with this room 
that is.

There's also a Hi-Potion and Cardkey in the east room behind a gate, if 
you're low on health.

Room 7: N/A
	This is a nice rest room, and your goal is actually just on the 
other side, however, you can't get there at the moment.  So start by 
shooting the explosive barrel on the ledge to get the Boxemon level, 
and then melee the red box down to get lots of supplies, DO NOT 
however, shot the red box, as you will not get the supplies if you do 
so, rendering the level impossible.  When your ready, head north to the 
next area.

Room 8: Floating Mine x10
	Now your trapped in a small box and you need to keep the floating 
mines from getting too close and blowing up (if they do, you may get a 
nice chain effect and not be able to stand for a while).  Well, this is 
rather easy to counter, simply zoom into first person with a handgun, 
position yourself so your reticule is between to of the blue bars, and 
shoot any floating mine that enters the hallway, ta-da!  Next room.

Room 9: Black Widow x1
	This is probably the hardest room to win in, but what you have to 
do is rather easy, just run in circles unloading on the machine until 
he dies, using items as needed.  Magic does help here, but not that 
much.

Room 10: Epiolnis x4
	Very simple room, just pull out a handgun and take two/three 
shoots on each Epiolnis, EZ.

There's also a Cardkey and Potion to in a room to the east.

Room 11: Deepground Rocketeer x3
	Another easy room, once you enter the room, begin running back 
and forth, shooting the Rocketeers until they're dead.

A Cardkey and Ether can be found in the dead end going east.

Room 12: Deepground Soldier x2, Ninja x3, Elite Soldier x3
	Yet another simple room, run around the barrels and unload your 
handgun on the ninja's and soldiers, then head to about where they were 
standing to get the Elite Soldiers to come out, finish them off and 
continue on.

Hi-Potion and Cardkey in a room to the south. (and if you like 
climbing, try getting on top of every stack of boxes in the room, 
you'll need plenty of machine gun ammo to get to figure out how to get 
onto the ones in the SW corner though. [shows you what I do in my free 
time]  =P. Alright, next room!)

Room 13: Bizarre Bug x4
	Yet ANOTHER easy room, if your feeling conservative, it's rather 
easy just to melee the Bizarre Bugs to death, but of course, you can 
always just shoot them all to death.

Room 14: Ninja x8, Elite Ninja x2
	It gets a tad bit harder here, due to their numbers, just shoot 
'em all down, or magic the group to death, your choice.  You don't have 
to worry about the Elite Ninja's until you either kill all the other 
ninja's, or shoot at an Elite Ninja (or get too close, but I haven’t 
tried that one yet).

An Ether and Cardkey in the west hall.

Room 15: Cactuar x3
	This room can be easy or hard, depending on how quick you kill 
the Cactuars, if you go a little too slow, the Cactuars will begin 
attacking and it will be like going through hell to try and stop their 
constant bouncing!  So rule of the room, kill the Cactuars quickly!

Room 16: Deepground Soldiers (with shield materia) x10
	Get your magic ready, heal yourself up and put your item choice 
onto ether/elixir, run in, head towards the barrels, and (once the 
soldiers come out) start unloading your magic and letting loose your 
melee attacks.  A Limit Breaker can be used here, but due to how slow 
Vincent is when in is transformed state, I wouldn't recommend using it.  
Once you've killed all the soldiers, grab the cardkey and your done! 
... Seriously this time.

There's also an EX File (3) in the SW corner of the room (I'm not sure 
if it's there in room 7...).

My Best Time: 0:23

==================================

This is an extremely simple level, and I'm sorry for anyone who has any 
trouble with it.

	All you need do is destroy a box, and kill what's in it, if a 
Dual Horn comes out, restart.  Simple as that.  There's only one Dual 
Horn, so you should be able to get all three Cactuars before you find 
him, and if all else fails (I haven't actually tried this) just run 
around destroying all the boxes killing only Cactuars, Red Saucer 
machines and soldiers (as the Dual Horn takes to long to kill and the 
machines will slow you down if Dual Horn is chasing you).

==================================

Mission 7 - Gatling in the Wastes

Mission:    Earn 500 Points

To get the capsule, if you run to the NWish corner (by the small crevice) 
alot of cactuars will spawn, and only cactuars will drop ethers, and only
near the end of the level.
Thanks to nmj7towa@hotmail.com

Alternatively, adhvt@hotmail.com has informed me that if you kill the
Dual Horn in level 6 without him leaving the screen in hard mode, he
will drop a Manaheart, which is an item you can use to replenish your
magic so you can shoot the capsule.  Thank you adhvt!

My Best Time: 3:

==================================

Here's how the point system goes on this level:
        Purple Hound:   1 point
        Red Hound:      3 points
        Epiolnis:       5 points
        Cactuar:        20 points
        Dual Horn:      30 points

	So start out by jumping on the gatling gun to the right of you, 
and start shooting away at everything below you, once you either reach 
50 points, or a Dual Horn or two appear, jump down and head behind you, 
to the nearest gatling gun sitting on a mound to the west of your 
starting point, and start shooting until either your health starts 
getting low, or there's a lack of spawn of enemies.  If either of those 
things happen, jump off and head west until you reach a potion, use it 
and jump on the gatling gun to the right (north) of the potion and 
finish off the level.  There's 3 or 4 other guns around the place, and 
potions spread all over the level, so run towards these as needed (just 
be aware of the time it'll take to do so).  Make sure the Cactuars and 
Dual Horns are your top priority (that's not just for points) and 
constantly do a check around you every time you get a free moment, to 
make sure no ones coming from behind.

==================================

For sake of easiness, I'm going to tell the gargoyle areas by Location 
on the map relative to the center area, e-mail me if you need 
clarification on any of them.

Center Gargoyle: Purple Hounds
	Run around the mountain in the middle killing any hounds that 
spawn until a gargoyle spawns, kill the gargoyle and continue on.

North Gargoyle: Red Hounds
	Head north, then west along the half circle path, a gate will 
come up behind you.  Continue on until you grab a potoin, then turn 
back and before you get to the gate, a gargoyle and some hounds will 
spawn.  Killing the hounds first will probably be the easiest way to 
defeat this.

East Gargoyle #1: Epiolnis's
	If you can kill this gargoyle fast enough, you won't have to 
worry about killing anything else, if not, then you have to circle 
around killing anything that spawns up while trying to finish off the 
gargoyle (I've found that if you've got enough life and a few potions, 
you can just run after the gargoyle and dodge the Epiolnis's on the 
way).
	
East Gargoyle #2: Red Hounds
	Just unload on the gargoyle ignoring the hounds, once the 
gargoyle dies, the hounds will as well.

South Gargoyle: Purple Hounds
	Run around in circles taking out the hounds first, then finish 
off the gargoyle.

South West Gargoyle: Bizarre Bugs
	Run in circles aiming for the gargoyle, the Bizarre Bugs 
shouldn't be able to catch you if you continue running, and once the 
gargoyles dead that Bizarre Bugs die also.

West Gargoyle: Sahagins
	Make a full circle around the center area (you have to get the 
gargoyle to spawn) using the machine gun to kill the Sahagins, as this 
is the most useful weapon versus them.  Once you've done that, head up 
the center from the west and a gargoyle and a lot of Sahagins will 
spawn, I would recommend aiming solely for the gargoyle with a handgun, 
but that's just my preference.

Final Gargoyle: Gargoyles
	Head back to the northern gargoyle area, except go left into the 
castle, and get ready for a battle.
	Now for the hard part (that is if you don't have a lot of ammo 
like I did).  I didn't count exactly how many gargoyles there are, nor 
do I want to go back through the level to find out, so I'm just going 
to stick with 8-9 of them and they each have 2000 health.  All you can 
really do is just shoot, shoot, heal, shoot and hope.  I'd say that if 
you want the best chance for living however, back out of the castle 
area and kill them as they come through.  Good Luck.

My Best Time: 7:43

==================================

This is a very frustrating map, for the most part, it just takes 
persistent trying and re-trying to win.  Cait Sith's lag time is 
horrendous, and will get you attacked if you don't time your attacks 
perfectly.  Also another annoying feature of Cait is how long he'll lay 
down if he gets hit too hard, and you'll probably be half dead by the 
time you get back up.

	Here's each animals life:
		Blue Hound:       1
		Red Hound:        3
		Sahagin:          3
		Bizarre Bug:      4
		Ninja:            4

	And the locations of each moogle (which will heal 300pts each):
		J-9	- Inside the train.
		M-13	- Behind the fire.
		H-10	- On top of the barrels and crates.
		8-B	- Behind a large crate.

	At first, just run around and kill all the hounds you find, Red 
Hounds will start spawning somewhere in between 5-10 kills and then 
Beetles will begin spawning when you have between 15-20 kills.  Once 
you see/hear the first Bizarre Bug, go and find a low ledge (such as 
the hitch on the train housing the moogle - which will probably be your 
best choice, as this is where the most guys go - or a crate or barrel) 
and just continue doing your first attack unless some one tries to jump 
on with you, then press attack again to do your back flip and kick them 
off.  Whatever you do, don't do your third attack however, as this will 
most likely throw you off the edge and you may not get back up again.  
At 40 kills, the amphibians will begin popping up, jump off your 
platform and attack these guys from the ground, due to their slowness, 
they're fairly easy to win against (Cait's third attack is the best 
against these guys, as it can hit a lot of them, and will most likely 
kill them right away).  Once you hit 60 kills, Ninja's will begin 
coming to fight, the best way to kill these is to get them to make an 
attack first, then while they're recuperating, attack them.  Upon 
killing 80 animals, everything begins spawning, from hounds to Ninja's, 
so now just go all out using the skill you've gained with Cait Sith to 
get this far to finish up this level.

==================================

This can be extremely hard, or extremely easy, depending on what you 
do...

	Start off by getting the scope off of your rifle, and having an 
auto reload on all of your weapons (you can do this between missile 
fire at the start), as these are essential.  Now position yourself 
between the plane and the barrel, (zoom in so you can get this 
positioning right) just at a position so that you can still shoot over 
the barrel but just barely (so that you have to aim higher than normal 
to get over the barrel) and place yourself a little more to the right 
than seems comfortable, as the missiles coming from the left seem to 
get around the barrel easier than the ones on the right (don't go to 
far right though, just like one step).  If you did it right, not a 
single missile will hit you, and you can relax... however, you won't 
know if you did it right unless you get blown up!  So just act like the 
barrels only there to get in the way and won't save you, and start 
firing at any missiles that come at you!  Keep this up for three 
minutes and your good... oh, and if you didn't figure it out by now, 
there gets more and more missiles the longer you stay alive.

Collect the medals, not really as hard as it sounds, you just can't 
mess up really...

	Start by turning around and grabbing the potion, then run up the 
stairs, kill the soldier through the fence, continue up the stairs and 
kill the soldier on your way up.  Once at the top, turn right and kill 
the soldier, run to his body, turn right, and begin your descent.  Grab 
the medal half way down, then continue down towards the bottom.  At the 
bottom, turn left and head up the stair case until you grab the EX 
Medal, then jump off to the right so you land on the other side of the 
red fence.  Run into the house turn left and head up the stairs, kill 
the guy at the top, grab the medal, and head back down and out the door 
in front of the stairs.  Run along the wall until you come to some 
stairs on the left, run up them and turn around and run towards the 
house.  Kill the two soldiers, then run past the door and turn around 
the corner to the left, jump up the crates and grab the medal, kill the 
guy that falls down, then go into the house.  Get up the two flights of 
stairs and run out the back window, onto the wall.  Turn left and kill 
the soldier and grab the medal by his body.  Run back towards the 
house, then continue on past it.  Head into the chapel and turn to your 
left, grab the medal and jump off, grab the medal at the bottom, turn 
towards the large double doors and kill the soldier.  
	Stand on the magic replenisher (you'll need it) then run out the 
doors, turn right and jump off the gap between the wall grabbing the 
medal on the way down, turn to your right and head back up the stairs.  
Head back to the front of the chapel, run past the doors and turn right 
around the corner, kill the soldier, grab the medal by his body, and 
head back into the chapel.  Once inside, go behind the stand in the 
back center, and head up the construction stairs, climb up the ladder, 
and head across the walkway to the other side of the chapel.  Turn 
right and head up the two sets of ladders, kill the soldier at the top 
of the tower, grab the medal and jump back down.  Now go midway across 
the walkway and turn right and head out the opening onto the wall.  
Follow the wall until you see a ladder sticking up to your right with a 
gap in the wall (just before the cargo).  Jump off there and grab the 
medal, then climb back up, turn to your right and continue along the 
wall.  Kill the soldier, grab the medal and head right, down the stairs 
to the bottom.  A soldier with a shield materia will drop down,  shot 
him with a fireball, run and melee him once or twice (not three or else 
you'll fall off the ledge).  Turn to the left and grab the medal, then 
finish the soldier off with a fireball and possibly another melee.  Now 
head along the wall to your right (south wall) until you come to a gap 
in the houses on your right, grab the medal, then head back and 
continue along the wall until you reach the east end, there will be one 
last soldier and the last EX Medal to your right, kill him and grab it 
and you finished! Phew!

Something must have inspired Square Enix, as we have yet another dodge the 
explosions level.  Really easy, just keep the concept of corners in 
your mind.

	Now, if you get knocked of the wall, you have 5 seconds (from the 
second you begin falling) to get back on, which is really hard to do, 
due to the size of the wall, and how mines will be flying at you while 
you try to do so, so in short, stay on the wall.  Now, all you really 
have to do, is make sure your handgun and machine gun both have auto 
reload on, then run onto the skinny ledge to the right, just in front 
of you and back up to the very, very back of it (because some mines 
will get really close, so you don't want to get hit because you were 
too scared to get close to the edge).  Now aim forewords (so you're 
looking down the small path you just came from, and kill anything that 
steps in front of you.  Do not sway too much trying to kill mines you 
see in the edges of your vision, as you there may just be a mine that 
will come at you while you turn to destroy the other one, and you won't 
be able to see it, so just try to stay looking foreword and only 
killing things that step in your way.  If you do that, you'll be just 
fine.
	If you have troubles with this method, I'd suggest you experiment 
and find a way that works for you.

==================================

The only way to beat this map, is to learn where the snipers are at the 
beginning.  And there's only one good way to do that, and that's by 
going through the start a lot... sigh*, let's get started.

	You start out with barely any ammo, so you have to be very 
accurate and conservative.  Use only your sniper, it shouldn't take 
more shots than 2 for anything (you'll have about 4 shots left at the 
end if you kill everyone with one or two shots depending on the 
enemy... which means you have a few shots leniency).
	Alright!  Start out by moving to your left a little, and looking 
up at the ridge of the canyon, where a broken bridge sticks out, head 
shot the soldier up there, then continue going left until you hit the 
canyon wall, then walk foreword, training you scope on the top of the 
canyon, above where you just were.  Take out the soldier up there with 
one shot.  Now look at the red fence, then follow along the path 
upwards, until you see a stationary turret (Twin Sentry), destroy the 
Twin Sentry in two shots (by aiming in the center).  Continue along the 
canyon wall, keeping you reticule focused across the canyon at the 
corner on the right (past the broken bridge) and you'll see a soldier 
as you move across.  Immediately to the right of that soldier, standing 
behind the broken bridge at the bottom of the canyon, is another 
soldier, kill both of them with one shot (don't forget to grab the ammo 
to the left/behind you).  Head up the hill on the left and grab the EX 
Medal, then head to the opposite side of the canyon, training you view 
across the canyon, on the left corner, until you see another soldier, 
kill him.  Now run under the broken bridge and grab the medal, then run 
up the bridge and look onto the ledge across the canyon for a 
rocketeer, make sure you get two head shots, then head onto the ledge 
and grab the medal up there.  Look out and kill the Rocketeer on the 
ledge on the right with two headshots (you must get two headshots to 
kill him in two shots, but don't worry too much if you use and extra 
shot).  Jump down and grab the ammo then  turn to your left and follow 
the top of the canyon around the corner, once you see the soldier up 
there, kill him.  Then run towards the medal under the tower, but don't 
grab it yet, instead kill the rocketeer that is standing across the 
canyon directly in front of you.  Then head closer to the medal, 
looking above and to the left of the rocketeer you just killed (up on 
the ledge) until you find and kill the soldier up there.  Now grab the 
medal if you haven’t then run up the ledge behind/to the right of you 
(along the back of the canyon) and grab the ammo.  
	Head back down, looking across the canyon, until a Twin Sentry 
appears, kill it with two shots to its center, and now head up the 
ledge.  There's a soldier sniping across the canyon, on the other side 
from where you are, take him out, and now if you've missed anyone, 
you'll now it once you reach the top of the ledge, kill them if you 
have.  As you head over the peak of the ledge towards the ammo, there 
will be a soldier with his head sticking up just over the edge, kill 
him, then grab the medal on the broken bridge to your left and head 
further along the ledge, grabbing the ammo on your way.  As you near 
the end of the ledge, slowly move yourself over, to the edge until you 
either see a head, or get shot at (you'll probably get shot at first).  
Kill the soldier, then begin making your way closer to the building in 
front of you, but still move slowly until you see and kill the soldier 
that is crouching to the right of the soldier you just killed.  Now 
look at the building, there are two Twin Sentries, if you have enough 
ammo to take one of them out (if you have enough to take both out, I'm 
impressed!), then do so, but instead of heading towards the building, 
turn and jump off the ledge to your left, grab the ammo, and run along 
the canyon bottom going away from the building, grab the medal that is 
sitting on the broken bridge and the ammo that’s under it, and head 
along the west wall (the one you should be closest to) and grab the 
medal down there.  Now head back to the building for the last medal, 
take out any remaining Twin Sentries, and make your way towards the 
building, but don't go in... unless you have a death wish.  Now come up 
against the wall of the building (or at least close to it) and aim 
inside the building through the door.  Shot the rocketeer inside once, 
then run out of view (do otherwise and you'll be committing yourself to 
about 500pts of damage), then run back in and try to shot him as 
accurately as you can, repeat if he isn't dead, and continue repeating 
until he does die.  Now run to the other side and repeat all your 
motions for the rocketeer on the other side (don't worry if you end up 
having to use some handgun ammo to finish the job).  Yay!  Now you can 
run in and grab the eighth and final medal!
...NOT!
Yay, now you must get 20 medals!
	SIGH*, should've seen that coming... Now head back the way you 
came, open the blue gate, but don't go through it, instead, head back 
to the starting point, and climb up the now accessible ladder and grab 
the Elixor at the top, then use it.  Now head back to the steps where 
you opened the blue gate and pull out your machine gun (if you have any 
handgun bullets, use the handgun instead), ready your materia, and step 
up the last few steps around the corner and shot a fireball (or 
something) at the rocketeer around the corner, two ninja's will also 
jump out, and if you timed it right, you'll hit all three of them.  
Make sure you finish off the rocketeer at all costs however, as he 
hurts!  The ninja's will now spawn in groups of two's from now on, 
every fifteen seconds or so, until you kill everyone (the ninja's will 
also be your source of ammo until then).  Now turn to your right and 
make your way over the hill, kill the three soldiers and head towards 
the building.  Get up against the left wall, like you did with the 
rocketeers in the other building, and shoot the Elite Soldier in the 
corner, then you can go in safely and pick up the loot.  Also, I'd 
actually recommend killing the rocketeer and soldier to the right 
before taking on the Elite Soldier, but your choice of order here.  
Either way, kill the two, but don't head towards them, we're gonna go 
backwards here (I found it was easier that way).  So head up to the 
ledge (don't jump off!)  and run along it, picking up the two medals on 
the overhangs as you go across, and killing whoever you can target to 
the right with your sniper.  After getting the two medals by the ledge, 
run back and forth along the edge and continue killing guys (including 
ninja's) until it seems no one's left.  Now run in, wherever you want, 
and run along the edge of the town collecting all the medals.  It 
shouldn't be too hard, but here are all the medals locations (not 
including the one in the second building or the two on the ledges).

E-11
C-12
D-10
E-8
D-7 (rocketeer will fall in front of you)
E-6

	Once you have 17 medals, head to the last building (on the 
opposite side as the second building you went in) with a red fence.  
Jump over the red fence and, you guessed it, a catch, a Dual Horn is 
waiting for you (it's rather entertaining to come around the corner of 
the door zoomed in on your rifle, and see a large bull face on your 
screen).  It's not hard though, just run around collecting the last 
three medals, and since the dual horn can't turn fast enough, if you go 
for the back ones first, then head for the middle one, he won't even 
touch you.  NOW you're done!  Congratulations!

==================================

This level wasn't too hard, I did it on my second try without a 
problem, since the guys are a lot weaker, it doesn't take that long to 
kill them, the only hard part is watching your health, as sometimes you 
forget about it and die (or get close to it).  A quick tip is to heal, 
heal, heal, even if you only have a little damage done to you, because 
one: it'll keep you alive, and two: you get lots of potions anyways.

	For the most part, just run around killing all the hounds and 
ninja's that spawn up.  If a gargoyle spawns, kill it as fast as you 
can, since they have long range, and you don't have to worry, they 
can't fly up higher to where you can't reach in this level. Careful for 
the Elite Swordsmen (Ninja), because they can pack a punch, and they 
won't fall over on the third attack, but for the most part, there 
fairly easy, as usually, your melee attack will push you to the back of 
the swordsman right as he attacks, allowing you to attack again and 
finish him off. The gargoyles will drop Hi-Potions when you kill them, 
and the Elite Swordsmen will drop X-Potions (which with only 780 
health, they both do the same thing, but it lets you carry 4 potions, 
instead of 2).  One last guy to talk about, the Cactuar.  Some where 
around 75+ kills, a Cactuar will spawn and begin running around the 
level at a very high pace.  Don't chase him, as you probably figured, 
you won't be able to catch him, instead, if you stand by the door of 
the chapel and continue fighting like normal, the Cactuar will come to 
you by running up the stairs, then taking a little detour around the 
front of the chapel, this is where you can hit him nice and easy, if 
you miss, don't worry, he'll come back again.  You don't have to worry 
about the Cactuar attacking you either, because he won't.  Once you 
kill him however, he'll drop a cardkey, which you can then use to open 
up the gate surrounding the capsule, or the other gate by the two 
towers, which I actually have no clue as to what's in there.

This is probably the easiest map so far, besides the Widow Missileer.  
Azul and Rosso both have practically no health, and neither of them 
transform into a more stronger being upon their initial defeat.  I was 
really tempted to give this map a 1/5 difficulty, but decided that it 
could be kind of hard if you ended up getting in the way of Azul's gun 
too often, but Rosso isn't even a problem.

	Start out by pulling out a handgun, circling around the pillar in 
a widish curve, and unloading on Azul.  He should be dead in a matter 
of seconds, and with how slow he is, he probably will only be able to 
shot you once or twice.  With Azul dead, just run towards Rosso, and in 
a few shots, she'll be a goner.  Your done.

==================================

This level was pretty hard at first, but after doing some thinking and 
looking around, I discovered how easy it really was, so if you can't 
seem to get the insight I had, then read on.  Oh, and two things you 
should know about this level that may help you, one: don't shot the 
barrels when you're (practically) in the same room as them, as they 
will kill anyone in a large radius with a one hit kill, including you.  
Two: be cautious and trigger happy, which I find don't usually mix, but 
they do here, walk around corners slowly, and once you see someone, 
don't stop shooting until they're dead... get my drift?

	Turn right and head towards the tunnel on your left after you've 
spawned.  Once facing down the tunnel, take as many shots as you can at 
the rocketeer at the end, you'll probably on get one or two shots in.  
Follow him.  As you turn the corner, a soldier will run up, if you shot 
fast enough (which isn't really fast) you'll kill him before he even 
figures out what happened.  Once you pass his body and turn around the 
corner, the rocketeer may take an extra shot at you before he resumes 
running away, so be ready to dodge a rocket.  After the rocketeer 
leaves (or you've gone around the corner), head foreword towards the 
room, but don't go in, or you'll be ruthlessly shot at by two guys at 
the bottom of the room, and two at the top.  Instead head into the 
alcove on the right, and climb up the ladder, then, crouch and sneak up 
to the ledge, the soldiers will begin shooting at you, but don't worry, 
they can't hit you from where you're standing.  So look down off the 
ledge at a barrel in the center of the room behind a pillar, shoot it 
and you'll kill all four of the soldiers with out taking a hit.  Now 
jump off the ledge.  There's a good chance that the pestering rocketeer 
is in some odd place waiting for you when you drop down, so, if he's to 
the right of you, don't run towards him, but back up and shot at him 
until he runs away or dies, and if he's behind/in front/to the left of 
you, pursue him until he's dead.  Now, head back to where you fell down 
if you're not there, then walk around the corner to your right and shot 
the barrel that comes into view (don't worry, this barrel won't kill 
you, but it will kill the person next to it).  Now turn left and head 
down the hall.  As you do so, there's a terrible chance that a Widow 
will come and fire a beam that may or may not kill you, but as for me, 
I've died from it on every hit so far, so just run forward until you 
see it coming, then immediately turn begin backing up and head up the 
stairs to the right.  Now just continue taking quick shots going back 
and forth on the stairs until you finish it off.  
	Once your finished, go and make sure that you kill the rocketeer 
you saw at first, as you will not be able to beat this level unless he 
is dead.  Once he's dead, head down the hall were you killed the Widow, 
and head through the sewers until you come to the last underground 
pipe, and past that is a ladder around the corner.  Head up the stairs 
to the left of the pipe, and then up the stairs just above the pipe, 
and up the ladder.  At the top, sneak over to the ledge and shot the 
barrel that comes into sight on the ground.  Then go around the corner 
to your right and kill the soldier by the ladder there.  Now continue 
heading towards the three gaps by the soldier you just killed 
(southward from the soldier) and go towards the pipe on the left.  
Three ninja's will spawn up.  Kill them, and head down the tube and 
grab the cardkey at the bottom, then head back up and drop off the 
ledge to the bottom of the room, and head towards the 'C' on the wall 
straight in front of you.  As you come around the corner on the right, 
shoot the barrel, which should kill one or two soldiers (if any more 
come, kill them... of course).  Now go unlock the gate and head inside 
(yet another chance of getting picked on by anywhere from 1-3 more 
soldiers).  As you walk into the room, there will be a rocketeer and a 
couple soldiers standing on the top platform, on the platform below 
them (and closer to you) is a barrel, which if you shoot, will kill at 
least one of the three or four soldiers in the room.  I had two 
soldiers on the top level that I killed with the barrel, and one 
soldier that came to the right of me and starting hitting me with a 
melee attack... odd tactic.  Well, whatever happens, kill off all the 
soldiers how you see fit, and jump up and down (or however you want to 
do it) and kill the rocketeer.  Once he dies, the screen will shake, a 
medal will spawn, and the blue gates will diminish.  Now go get your 
medal... NOT... again... one last fight, a Elite Ninja will fall down 
on top of a box (which I have found if you just shoot at him and don't 
get too close, he'll just glitch and stay put on the box).  Once you 
finish him off, now you can go grab your reward. (BTW - for anyone that 
might not be able to get past the gate, and see no other rocketeer in 
the last room, that means you didn't kill the first rocketeer you saw 
at the beginning of the level, go do so now)

==================================

Alright, this is a fairly diverse map, for so small of a map, you need 
to get past a large group of undead (and unkillable) soldiers, by 
running up to the top of the structure you start in.  There are, 
however, cargo boxes that have a lot of health (or high resistance for 
that matter), that stand in your way.  Any attack will deal damage to 
these boxes, and I have absolutely no idea which is best.  What I did 
was use a machine gun, combined with a few melee attacks and materia 
shots to break them... but the way you get through these is entirely up 
to you.  Also, many of these boxes will hold something like an Ether or 
Potion to aid you in your fight to the top, so if you want to take the 
time to destroy some of the side boxes, then go right ahead.

	Start by turning immediately around and heading up the ramp, 
destroying at least two of the boxes on your way up (so you can get 
up).  This level is really, very self-explanatory, but anyways... head 
to your left down the hall, then turn to your right and head up and 
destroy to levels of boxes, then shoot the barrel that's about a third 
of the way up and destroy any more boxes that keep you from making it 
up further.  At the top of that hall, turn to your right and shot the 
barrel and destroy any more boxes that stand in your way.  Once at the 
top, head towards the now visible goal on your left.  You won't be able 
to get there without having a large stack of boxes appear before you 
and a boss health bar appear in the top right hand side of the 
screen.... time to start shooting.  Let loose all your materia and 
bullets, and even melee attacks... try not to worry about anything that 
comes up and attacks you.. unless you have to.  I found that if you 
stand by the ramp and shoot at the boxes, then move back and forth 
between visibility (from the top of the ramp towards the goal, then 
back) of anyone down the hall, that you'll stall them from getting up 
as fast as they'll stop and get ready to shot, then when you move, 
they'll stop and start moving again, then when you come back they'll 
stop and prepare to shot again... etc.  However you do it, go stand in 
the goal when you are finished.

==================================

Kk, there's three main points you should know about this level, point 
one: it will only take one shot to kill most of the snipers (no 
guarantees), two: there are hidden mines floating all around the map, 
and you won't be able to see them until you get very close to them, at 
which point you'll probably have set it off... the only way to really 
get past these are to either be lucky and miss them or get close enough 
and notice so you can shoot them without having to worry about getting 
hurt, or to notice before the blow up and run away, in which you have 
about a second or two to get away once you step too close.  Lastly: 
keep on the lookout, there are snipers everywhere, and people will 
spawn all the time, so don't expect that since you killed one guy, that 
area is safe.

	Look out the door, there are three people you'll be able to kill 
from standing in the door from, one person on top of the tower in front 
of you, another on top of the building waaaaay back there, standing by 
a barrel to the right of the tower, and another guy by the cargo box to 
your right, and upon moving to your left, out of the building a little, 
you'll be able to see the very top of a guy's head poking out of the 
sand.  Now as you move foreword, there will be a soldier standing by a 
rock to your right, and ninja's will begin spawning.  Also, floating 
above the cargo box that was by the soldier at the beginning, is a 
mine, just to warn you.  Behind the broken bridge by the tower is yet 
another soldier, and behind a gate on the left side of the is a soldier 
with a machine gun, but don't go out of your way to kill him, because 
you'll get to in an easier fashion later.  To the right, is a building 
that has some refreshments in a red box inside (which you must shoot, 
not melee to get anything out of it this time)... for a price of 
course, and a soldier that is standing in the front of the building by 
some cargo... btw, there's also a mine floating above the cargo, so be 
cautious.  Now head to the backside of the tower (it would actually be 
the front... wouldn't it?) and head in, but watch out for the mine 
sitting in the door way.  
	When you walk in, 4 Stygians will spawn, kill them, and shot the 
barrel through the window to your right (which will kill the soldier 
with the machine gun if you haven’t killed him yet), then head around 
past the barrel and up the ramp to the outside.  Three ninja's will 
spawn and attack you, and if you go stand by the gate that just dropped 
by the ladder at the edge, and shoot the barrel as they fall down, 
you'll kill (or knock off) them all.  Head up the ladder and watch out 
for the mine at the top... In front of you two soldiers will spawn on 
the tower, kill them, then make your way on the edge to the left around 
the tower, when you come to the third corner, three soldiers will spawn 
on the tower in front of you.  After killing them and going around the 
corner, three cactuars will spawn, finish them off, then, being wary of 
the mine sitting right by the cardkey, grab the cardkey and head down 
and forewords (north) until a large blue gate appears.  Use the cardkey 
and get through.  To your right is a soldier in front of a building, 
upon getting closer to the structure, two Black Widows will spawn, 
thankfully, nothing else will spawn however, and you can grab the 
cardkey inside in peace.  Now head towards the building across the 
canyon to the west.  Upon getting closer, three Stygians will appear 
and a gate will go up, kill them and the soldier to the left and begin 
heading forewords.  If you have the mine detector, it will be going 
crazy right now, or in other words, there are mines everywhere, so be 
very careful.  There are no more mines past the gate however, so once 
you get there, your home free!

This level is mostly, just annoying.  If you've actually played through 
the game to get here, you'll notice the ghosts tactic is that of 
Weiss'.  He'll warp around, a lot.  He does not, however, have any 
attack, so you need not worry about him hurting you, but there are 
three different kinds of monsters that will be spawning randomly, and 
killing them could offer you the reward of more ammo, but no potions or 
ethers here.

	There's not much I can say about this level, since everything in 
it's random really... one nice thing is that the undead soldier will 
sometimes slow down or even stop for a moment, and I've found that 
shooting him will sometimes trigger him to do so.  So my main tactic 
was to either shoot repeatedly with my handgun until I finally hit him, 
then unload until he began moving again, or use my machine gun to get 
him to stop, then quickly change to my handgun and continue from there.  
Continue doing this until he's dead... easy as that.

This mission would be more descriptively titled if it where said 
"Defeat 100 Rocketeers".  But there's variety, so I'm not disappointed 
at it, just telling you that you're going to have to fight against 100 
enemies going up and down floors in intervals of 10's and 20's, and not 
just any enemies, Rocketeers.  This level wouldn't be as hard if it 
weren't for the terrible shooting of the rocketeers, as you will notice 
throughout this level, these guys aiming sucks, and because of that, 
you're gonna have rockets flying every which way, and with a ratio of 
1:10 in accuracy, most likely one of those will be headed at you, so 
staying put, and moving around are both dangerous chances you're going 
to have to take.  Now that I'm done telling you that, here we go!

	 Run outside, a 0/10 will appear, the first number is how many 
rocketeers you've killed, and the second, how many you need to kill 
before getting the cardkey to move onto the next part of the level.  
Upon grabbing the items, 10 rocketeers will appear on the first and 
second floors, most of them are in your view from where you're standing 
when they spawn, so just avoid the rockets and take them out one by 
one, using kill chains to make it easier on yourself.  Run up the next 
floor, there are 5 rocketeers that spawn if you get close to the red 
gate (south wall) in front of you, and five that spawn across from 
there (north wall) by the items.  After completing that, head up 
another flight.  Now, halfway across the walkway, ten guys will all 
spawn on the north end of the building, finish them off however way 
works best for you, grab the cardkey that appears above you and go up 
another floor.  To your left (south), is an item that will be guarded 
by a rocketeer when you get to close, and heading back to the north 
end, seven rocketeers will spawn around the walkways along the east and 
north walls.  Upon heading along the eastern walkway, four more guys 
will appear, and when you walk to the Limit Breaker at the end of the 
catwalk, four guys will spawn on the level below you (and you can shoot 
at them through the catwalk) and four on the top floor.  Upon finishing 
them off, head down the stairs on the east end of the building.  Walk 
across the catwalk and when you are about to make it across, a gate 
appears, head halfway back, and look down on the floor.  Rocketeers 
will begin spawning in growing intervals until you've killed twenty of 
them.  Then you can move on.  If you head along the walkway on the 
south wall, five rocketeers will spawn, and upon heading north along 
the west wall, five more guys will appear.  Head down to the last floor 
after finishing them off.  Now, once you reach the center of the bottom 
floor, rocketeers will spawn every which way on all different floors, 
including falling from the ceiling... I tried to count who was where, 
but it got a little out of control, so just start shooting and spinning 
around looking for anyone.  The game will automatically save and end 
the level upon killing the 100th rocketeer.

Weeeee, Cait again.... ugn.  A few things to take note of here... Rosso 
is fast, Cait Sith is slow, Rosso hurts, Cait Sith.. well.. doesn't 
hurt, and Rosso can attack long ranged, Cait Sith can't.  However, 
there is one upside to Cait Sith... and that's you, you can actually 
think about what you're doing, Rosso however, will just consistently 
attack in a few second intervals.

	And of course, the moogle locations for your 300hp break:

		G-14	- In an alley way behind where you spawn.
		J-11	- In front of a door.
		G-10	- Behind the monument.
		G-6	- In an alley opposite of the G-14 moogle.

	So with that said, start out by circling around Rosso until she 
attacks, if you get hit, continue circling around her, if not, attack 
her and resume running around her.  Repeat until she's dead or you need 
a moogle, or of course, you die.  Continue doing that until she's dead 
and you'll be done, easy as that.

==================================

This is a very, very... Very self explanatory map, you only have one 
guy that you must kill, so in essence, this is just a race to the 
finish map.  You probably don't need all the directions I'm going to 
give, but, it wouldn't be a complete guide on the Extra Missions 
without it... so here it is. Oh, and... All you need to do on this 
level is follow the item pickups found all throughout the level, if 
there's not an item showing you the way, then there's a gate that's 
blocking it, simple enough.  You may have some troubles getting through 
the level quick enough, but just keep trying until you can get it.

	Run through the door and to your right, then straight through the 
next two doors and now turn left.  Head foreword and through the door 
down the hall in front of you.  Go left, and then take another left, 
then head right down the hall and through the next door in front of 
you.  Then continue circling around the halls until you enter a cave, 
head straight through the cave until coming upon some barrels, shoot at 
least one of them (the leftmost being the best choice) and run past 
where it used to be and take a shallow left turn.  Jump over the red 
gates (if you get caught on any of them, turn yourself around so your 
back is facing where you want to go and press backwards and jump 
repeatedly) and head around the corner and foreword towards more 
barrels, destroy any you need to get through (I choose the right most 
ones) and head on foreword through the cavern.  Upon coming to the pit, 
do a delayed double jump (jump once, then wait a second and jump again) 
to get onto the platform (if you fall here, restart, as there's no way 
you'll be able to make it now), then jump onto the other side, turn 
right and continue on down the winding path.  Upon coming to the cargo 
boxes, just shoot them down (machine gun being the best way to get 
through with the least time) and run up the long spiral ramp to the top 
floor.  Head through the door at the top and turn right at the back of 
the room and go through the next door and right again and head to the 
back of that room and go through that door.  Turn left, jump (or run) 
down to the bottom ignoring the rocketeers, and head through the only 
open door to your right/in front of you (west).  Turn right through the 
door and wind through the maze of red gates, jumping over anything that 
gets in your way and the lowered gate at the end, then turn right 
through the door along the east wall.  Kill the rocketeer by shooting 
while either jumping over, or sliding under (with a melee attack) any 
rockets shot at you.  Then head through the door and to the left 
through the next door.  Turn left again, then make a right and jump 
over the lowered gates.  Run through the arrow made of items at the end 
of the winding hall, and go through the door, run around the machine 
and into the goal.. tada!

This level has only two different enemies, a Elite swordsmen, and Elite 
Soldiers, the soldiers hurt like mad, so make sure you get the first 
shot or else you'll have a hard time living through that fight, let 
alone the rest of the level.  This level isn't very difficult however, 
and here's how to get through it...

	Begin by running through the arch you can see on the left side of 
your screen when you start out.  There is a soldier on the other side 
of this arch waiting for you, so be cautious.  Go straight until you 
can see an explosive barrel, then head over the mound to the left of 
the barrel and through the arch on the left.  Head straight, past the 
open field on your left, and make two right turns at the corner.  Then 
look to your left and kill the soldier standing in the arch.  Then 
continue heading the way you were before you turned to kill him (to the 
right/north).  There's an opening between the gate and the wall, go 
past the gate through this opening and make a right turn around the 
corner, then a left turn through the arch, and another right around the 
block.  Head right into the open field, and go straight forewords 
through the opening in the wall.  Walk into the building, kill the 
swordsman that spawns, and grab the cardkey.  Now head back across the 
field and open the gate in the arch to your right.  Kill the soldier on 
the left side (on the other side of the arch) first, then turn around 
and kill the swordsman (to the north).  Now you're almost done, run up 
the mound and over the block, and repeat for the next block in front of 
you, and run to the doorway of the building, three swordsmen will 
spawn, kill them and run into the goal... you are now halfway done with 
the Extra Missions!

I thought this mission was rather challenging, until I learned that you 
can just beat up the Turk Robots, instead of having to go into a very 
hard battle with them (in which they will hurt very badly), then I just 
found this level time consuming... due to the fact that no items or 
ammo is dropped, there's two ways you can go about this level, either 
use all your ammo at the start and end up having to beat people to 
death at the end, or beat people to death at the start, and use your 
ammo at the end... not much of a choice.  One thing you should know 
however, is that the last guy in the area you kill drops the cardkey, 
not the Turk.

	Begin by running foreword towards the gate, kill the three 
soldiers that spawn, then turn around and head into the alley way 
between the fence and the starting point (I got three Cait Sith's to 
spawn out of the red crates, but it only happened once for me, so I'm 
not sure what really happens or how to get it to occur everytime, 
because of such, I infact wrote this guide without the Cait Sith's and 
re-checked it with the Cait Sith's).  A soldier will spawn halfway 
through, kill him, and kill the soldier that spawns once you make it to 
the other end of the alley.  Head left and down to the open area, two 
ninja's and a soldier will spawn to your left, kill them, and continue 
down the hall.  In the area right before the gate, a soldier and a Turk 
will spawn, kill the soldier then use the following tactic to kill the 
Turk, if you didn't know how to do this before hand: (Turk's won't 
attack until they've been attacked, so run up to it, hit it until it's 
on the floor, then shoot until it begins to get back up, then melee it 
back to the floor again and continue doing this until he's dead).  
Failure to do this tactic will result in you playing an impossible 
level, so have fun!  Grab the cardkey and run on to the next area.  
Kill the two soldiers that spawn behind the barrel, then the next two 
that spawn behind the barrels on the left and the barrel on the right.  
In the little alcove to the left, two ninja's will spawn, kill them, 
and in the alcove in the back of the area, three ninja's will appear.  
	I do not know exactly what triggers the Turk to spawn here 
though, so just run around touching corners and walls until he does, 
then kill him, get the cardkey and head on.  Make two lefts around the 
corners and kill the two soldiers that spawn behind the crates on the 
other side of the fence, then kill the two soldiers that spawn on top 
of crates to the left of the last two soldiers.  Run around the gate 
and kill the two soldiers that spawn behind the crate, two gates in 
front of you, and the one to the right, beside a box, and another 
soldier to the right of the last soldier.  Run around the rest of the 
fences, and head towards the boxes in the middle.  Two Turk's will 
spawn, kill them one at a time (it gets really hard if you accidentally 
hit both of them), grab the cardkey and go on to the next sector.  Head 
down the stairs... then back up the stairs, then head to the back of 
the area (where the red gate is) then head back towards the stairs and 
10 ninja's will spawn and attack, finish them off to trigger the spawn 
of two Turk's, kill them one by one if you can, either way, kill them, 
and grab the cardkey, head back down the stairs and through the gate.  
Now head left up the stairs and you'll spawn a Turk, kill him however 
you can and head down the hallway to the right and make a right turn, 
another Turk will spawn, kill him in any manner and head down to the 
dead in in front of you (across from the door) to spawn the third Turk, 
kill him, grab the cardkey and head through the door to the last 
sector.  Now six Turk's will spawn around the center complex.  This is 
where the Cait Sith's can become an annoyance if they get out of hand, 
because they'll make some.. or even all if you're unlucky, of the 
Turk's start attacking, which is terrible to have to fight against more 
than one of them.  Either way, once you bash them to death, or shoot 
them with whatever you have left (or just left them to the cat's) you 
can get the last cardkey that lets you head up to the goal point.

==================================

This is just like Missilebreaker Melee, except now you have three 
planes to keep track of (and no barrel =P ).  The missiles will come in 
growing intervals, just like in the first one.  Keep your eye on the 
center plain, as it shoots the fastest missiles (but they're the 
easiest to dodge), and make sure to keep good track of the right plane, 
as it's missiles are quick as well.  The plane's missiles on the left 
however, will take forever before they actually get to you, making them 
very, very hard to dodge.

	Well, you have a pretty low supply of ammo, so my recommendation 
would be to use the rifle until you get to about a 1:15 left on the 
timer, then pull out your hand gun and use it for the rest of the time, 
but what you use is entirely up to you.  Everyone in a while, you will 
NEED to dodge a missile, and what I can say with that is, have fun 
dodging anything from the plan on the left, dodge the ones on the right 
by either running from the right side to the left, then jumping over 
the missile, or run from the left side to the right and go under it, 
and any missiles from the center plane, just run back and forth, as 
they are moving too fast to be able to follow you quick enough.  Try 
not to rely on any potions until after one minute... then make sure you 
use your potions, as you will be bounced around left and right and if 
you can get through this level without using all of your potions, I'll 
be very impressed.

==================================

Yet another Cait Sith level, yay... this one is a lot like Cait Versus 
the Crimson, except now you must fight Azul, but the tactic is pretty 
much the same... Azul is about as slow as you are now though =\ and he 
only has two attacks.

	And of course, the moogles that heal 300hp:
		G-10	-Opposite of where you start, behind the pillar
		K-9	-Off to the side by some lamps
		D-7	-Off to the side, opposite of K-9 moogle

	All you really need to do is run around Azul, making sure to keep 
close to him so he has less of a chance to fire his weapon (which I 
cannot find a way to dodge) and more of a chance to do his slow kick.  
Once he kicks, make sure your out of his way and attack him (also make 
sure you're beginning your attack as he's putting his foot down, doing 
the attack after that will result in him making his next attack on you 
before you can get away), then resume running around him and repeat 
until he dies.

There is nothing... I repeat, Nothing, hard about this level, you could 
just sit around and press right whenever your limit wears down and pick 
up any Limit Breaker's Cait drops, due to the fact that you are 
invincible when you are transforming and when you are in your limit 
break... well, here's a guide for this anyways.

	Cait will drop Limit Breaker's periodically, pick them up and 
transform whenever you can.  You won't have to worry about not having 
enough Limit Breaker's as Cait will drop them about every 2/3 of the 
length of a Limit Break, which means you'll have a plentiful amount of 
them at the end.  Just run around and do you're melee attack over and 
over again at anything that comes, pick up any Limit Breaks that come, 
and immediately use them once your previous one runs out and you'll win 
this level no matter what.

I thought this level was rather creative, and I like that.  It might 
not be the hardest of levels, but I found it rather fun.

	Run up to the popping noises your hearing on the right.  Behind a 
crate is a line of four Red Saucers, killing them will end the 
obnoxious popping... or you can have fun and try to hop over them =P.  
Once you get to the end, go right around the door and down the stairs.  
Upon grabbing the X-Potion in the back of the hallway, gates will come 
up and you must fight off three dark blobs before the blue gate will 
come down.  Now for some dodging.  Come up to the now available hall 
and wait for a black blob to come forward and disperse before it gets 
into the room, immediately run down a shot ways through the hall, to 
the little hole on the left.  Wait for the blob to pass again, then run 
forewords to the barrel and explode it at such a time that you kill a 
blob.  Now go stand right were the barrel was and look down the hall, 
wait for endlessly coming blob to disperse, then run into the small 
hiding area to the right a short ways down the hall from your current 
position.  Now wait for the blob to pass by again and run down the hall 
to past the red gate and up against the wall.  Look down the hall at 
the barrel, shoot it and wait for the blob to come at you and disperse, 
then run to where the barrel was.  Now wait for the blob to pass by 
again and head to down the hall into the alcove to the left, wait again 
for the dark mass to pass and head into the next alcove on the left, 
and wait one more time for the black blob to pass by, then run down the 
hall and up the stairs.  One thing left, and this is rather easy, just 
run foreword and jump over the Bull Head's as they near you, do this 2-
3 times and you'll be at the goal.  Yay!

==================================

This level's hard to stay alive on, there's endlessly spawning robots 
that will shoot, and shoot, and shoot at you.  So only take the time to 
kill the closer, more threatening ones.  Due to the randomness of the 
level, I will only give possibilities of someone being somewhere, if 
that.

	Begin by running outside and making an immediate turn to the 
left, run up the broken beam and jump off the edge and fall into the 
blue gate, grabbing the cardkey and EX Medal.  Use the cardkey to bring 
the gate down then head off going forewords (south) off the ledge and 
down by a barrel and another ledge with a medal on it, jump onto the 
barrel then onto the ledge, grab the medal and turn around.  Jump off 
and make your way onto the ledge in front of you (east) and into the 
man made tunnel.  Head through the tunnel making two rights then a left 
(there's a good chance 1-3 people will be waiting in the room here) 
head through to the other side of the room and make two more rights 
then a left (watch out for a could-be soldier to your right) and 
another left.  When you come out, there will most likely be a soldier 
on the ledge in front of you, head up to the top of that ledge and then 
up the ramp onto the bridge (most likely 1-3 soldiers up here to your 
left).  Head down the ramp to your right and grab the EX Medal on top 
of the barrel, then jump off making sure you land in the between the 
triangle of red gates, grab the medal, jump onto the barrel, and jump 
out.  Head up the ledge behind you, and run up the beam to the right.  
At the very top by the end of the beam, jump off to the left and grab 
the medal, jump onto the barrel and get back onto the beam.  Now jump 
over to the Limit Breaker and Materia Recharger, then turn around and 
jump down to the ledge with the medal on it.  Jump off of the ledge and 
run over to the bottom of the large beam in front of you and walk up 
past the items to the very end of the beam, then jump off to the right 
and grab the medal.  Now jump off, run back up the beam stopping at the 
items on the right, jump off grabbing the items and landing on the 
other side of the fence.  Head north towards the structure and grab the 
medal that is most likely being guarded by a soldier.  Head into the 
man made tunnel to your right and head up and right, then left into a 
room that probably has between 1 and 3 soldiers in it.  Head to the 
other end and head right, then right at the first hall, killing the 
soldier at the top, then head left and at the split, kill the soldier 
to the right, but head up to the left.  Once you reach the top, kill 
the soldier that is most likely there and turn all the way around to 
your left and kill any soldier that are standing by the structure in 
front of you, then run over in that direction.  Run down along the 
ledge to the right and then turn left at the split in the path, head 
all the way up and into the building (which is being guarded by a pink 
soldier) and grab the EX Medal.  Head back out and down to the split in 
the path and head straight down to the next medal down by the red gate 
and your finished!

And to help, I'll give re-explain where the medals are and how to get 
them in a list:
        1: D-8          Run to the top of the beam above this medal and 
                        drop down into the triad of gates.

        2: D-10 	Jump on top of the barrel beside the ledge and 
                        then jump onto the ledge.

        3: I-7          After running to the top of the structure, head 
                        down a ramp in the bridge and jump on top of a 
                        barrel by the edge.

        4: H-7          Jump down from the bridge (after collecting #3) 
                        and land in between the three gates, use the 
                        barrel to get out.

        5: G-10         Fall of the top of the broken beam by the 
                        bridge on the SE side, use the barrel/crate 
                        to get back up.

        6: G-9          Jump, to the east, off the ledge that has the 
                        Limit Breaker and Mataria Recharger on it 
                        (west of #5).

        7: E-9          Jump of to the west at the top of the third 
                        beam onto a small ledge.

        8: D-4          Run up (about halfway) the third beam until you 
                        get to some floating items off to the west (your 
                        right) then jump off grabbing the items on your 
                        way down so you fall on the other side of 
                        the fences, then run northward (to the right) 
                        and the medals sitting under the small tower.

        9: N-3          After running up through the tunnels to the 
                        right (east) of #8, head east along the path, 
                        then north up to a building behind a rock.

        10: K-7         From the building housing medal #9 head south 
                        then west down the path, to the medal sitting 
                        by a gate.

My Best Time: 

==================================

Probably the hardest part of this level is the mines... at least at 
first, but then the cactuars start getting pretty hard later on, and 
the mines are all gone anyways.  Two things that you probably already 
know, watch out for the mines (turn off all your music so you can hear 
the beeping) and watch out for the cactuars 100,000 needles attack, 
even though it's not that bad, once you have 10 cactuars all doing it 
at the same time, it starts getting a little scary.  Oh, and there's a 
cactuar that floats across the level, and upon killing him gives you a 
cardkey that allows you to access the building to your right when you 
first spawn (at about L-7) where you can get the capsule and grab some 
nice helpful items.

	Start out by grabbing the item in front of you, it's a mine 
detector and will help you a lot in the rest of this level.  Two 
cactuars will spawn on the other side of this item and three will spawn 
down below you right as you start out, so be ready.  And to kill the 
floating cactaur that will miss you just barely if you just stand right 
where you spawn, just follow it with your gun as it comes towards you, 
and start shooting like mad and you'll probably get it as it gets 
closer.  If you miss, don't worry, he'll comes back around and do it 
again in a few seconds.  For the rest of the level, more and more 
cactuars spawn depending on your kills, so just run around destroying 
mines in your down time, and kill anything that spawns.  Once you get 
around 70+, the numbers of cactuars will begin increasing dramatically, 
and it's probably a good time to use something like a Limit Breaker or 
Machine Gun.  Once you hit 100 kills, you can move on.

(P.S. I actually have no clue where the capsule really is, as I was 
just stuck in the building with the items once, and a cactuar did 
100,000 needles on me and I suddenly saw the saving pic up in the 
corner, so I'm not sure exactly where it is, I'm just guessing it's in 
the back middle of the building)

==================================

Azul's slow enough that you can dodge his attacks fairly easily, the 
only problem is getting out of the way before his next attack, so only 
attack Azul if he's still/just finishing off his attack, and only 
attack him on the side, or he'll be able to pull a faster attack on you 
if you're attacking him from the front.

Here's Azul's attacks and how you should avoid them: (actual damage 
amounts can vary greatly depending on where you are when you are 
attacked)

	Tail Whip: 
		Azul will whip his body and tail around in a 180
		Deals a little less than 700 damage
		Jump over his tail as is swings around.

	Claw:
		Azul will lift up his paw and bring it down and outwards in 
                a sweeping motion.
		Deals a little less than 300 damage.
		Run to the opposite side of the foot he is using and it'll 
                miss you.

	Head Butt:
		Azul will run towards you then dip his head in and scoop 
                his horns up
		Deals close to 400 damage.
		Try to run to his nearest side when he dips his head, as if 
                you try to run away when he's doing so, you'll get smashed 
                no matter how fast you are.

	Electric Charge:
		Azul will charge up a ball of electricity between his 
                horns, then let out 4 individual balls into the air, 
                they will then begin to home you.
		Deals about 150 damage per electrical ball.
		Run to Azul's side and begin attacking him, if you're close 
                enough to him, the electrical balls won't hit you.

	And of course, the locations of the moogles:
                I-5     - By the door in the alley.
                F-4     - By the front of a door to a house.
                E-5     - On the opposite side of the pillar from where you 
                          start.
                D-7     - By an open door in an alley.

	Begin by running up to his foot and doing a quick attack, then 
dodge each attack that he does in the manner listed above, and attack 
periodically, whenever you feel safe.  Due to the fact you have no time 
limit you can take your time and make sure you stay alive, instead of 
making sure you do as much damage as fast as possible.

One last thing, getting the capsule.  I found this rather easy, just 
get Azul to do his tail whip attack by standing close to one of his 
sides, then run back as he begins the attack and do your own attack 
once your fairly far away from Azul, the tip of the tail will whip 
around and hit your attack, causing you to break the capsule.

This mission is a lot like Deep Tower, except you have to fight 
different guys, and it's a lot easier.  A few pointers: explosive 
barrels are nice, not very much ammo is not nice... try saving your 
handgun ammo until the end.  I'm going to go through this like I did 
with the Deep Labyrinth, so here goes.

Sector 1: Deepground Soldier x20
	Once you stand on the Materia Replenisher 5 soldiers will spawn 
in front of you, and a few seconds after that, 5 more will spawn behind 
you.  Upon killing these ten, ten soldiers will spawn along the 
spiraling ramp in the middle of the area.  Once you've finished all 20, 
the blue gates go down and you can move on.

Sector 2: Deepground Hound x30
	Beginning with five hounds, hounds will be spawning periodically 
one by one after that until you get to 40, then they will spawn in a 
large group of 10, so just use your resources and finish them all off.

Sector 3: Deepground Sergeant x30
	Once you stand on the materia replenisher, 5 Sergeants will spawn 
in front of you, following that, 10 more will spawn in a line (which if 
you get onto one of the ends of the line and just take them out one by 
one, it's really easy), then 15 will spawn in a circle around you, this 
is a great time to use your materia shots and take them out quickly 
when they all clump together.

first, kill the Bull Head's by either doing a melee attack (I'd 
recommend trying to only melee them to death when your kill chain is 
above 2, so you can kill them in one round, or by running in circles 
and shooting their backs.  The only real problem here is the soldiers 
that will spawn up and ruin your day by shooting you and taking off 
your kill chain, which will make it very hard to get back up again.  If 
you need to get your kill chain up quickly sometime in the middle of 
the level, pull out your machine gun and unload on a group of Bull 
Heads to aggravate them and have them come running towards you, then go 
run to the other side of a barrel and blow it up when they get close, 
and bam, your kill chain will go up nice and quick, then you can resume 
doing melee attacks to finish them off.

	Head out into the field and kill the 3 Bull Heads with the barrel 
beside them.  Then 3 Bull Heads and 2 Soldiers will spawn a few times 
in a row by some barrels, kill them by shooting the nearest barrel, 
then finishing off anyone else left alive.  Now Bull Heads will begin 
spawning periodically, so just take 'em out as quick as you can, and 
make sure to keep a look out for any soldiers that may spawn, because 
like I said above, they'll ruin your day.  Also remember, kill chains 
will be the only way you're gonna finish this level, so do your best to 
keep them up high.

==================================

I thought this level was rather fun, Square really did a good job on 
making these abstract levels that you wouldn't expect to find in a 
popular shooter, and I like that.  This level wasn't overly hard, but 
it was terrible how you would spend 12 minutes running around the level 
then die at the very end, I did that 3 times before actually making it 
through.  This level was nice and challenging, kept you on your toes, 
and you didn't have to worry too much about your ammo, but enough to be 
constantly looking at it to make sure you weren't getting too low.  
Anyways... this level is just running around the complex 5 times, each 
time more amounts and more powerful enemies will appear as you make 
your way through.  To make this easy on myself, I'm going to go by 
room, and for each room, tell you about each level... if you're 
confused, read on and you'll see what I mean.

	Head to the right and up through the blue gate, down the hall and 
into...

Room 1 - Level...

	1: Deepground Soldier x1; Handgun Bullets x90
                Just kill the soldier, easy as that.
	2: Deepground Soldier x3; Handgun Bullets x75
                The two on the left nicely lined up for you, take them out 
                then move to the one on the right, kill him and head on.
	3: Deepground Soldier x3; Deepground Sergeant x1; Handgun Bullets x60
                They're lined nicely in pairs of two's, take a few shots at 
                them until they're dead and you should easily get past this 
                room without getting hurt.
	4: Deepground Soldier x1; Deepground Sergeant x4; Handgun Bullets x45
                Again, like level 3, they're lined in pairs, they just take 
                a bit longer to kill, resulting in a better chance to get 
                shot.
	5: Deepground Soldier x2; Deepground Sergeant x 4; Handgun Bullets x15
                These guys make two nice 3 person lines to fire down.  
                Grant them their obvious wish (which wish is to kill 
                them), and maybe moving back and forth a little to dodge 
                anything thrown back at you, you shouldn't have any trouble 
                here though.

	Leave the room and head into the next room around the corner.

Room 2 - Level...

	1: Floating Mine x1; Rifle Bullets x30
                If you run along the wall, then turn once you get to the 
                other side and leave out the other side, you don't really 
                need to worry about the ammo unless you want to though... 
                I never used the rifle.
	2: Floating Mine x3; Rifle Bullets x25
                Also another easy room, just run to the east wall (to your
                left when you come in) and run along being careful not to 
                hit anything on your way across.
	3: Floating Mine x4; Rifle Bullets x20
                This ones just about as easy as the last one, run to the 
                east wall again, and make your way across to the other 
                side while avoiding the mines... they are moving a bit 
                faster then last time though...
	4: Floating Mine x6; Rifle Bullets x15
                This is where the mines become a bit more challenging.  
                Run to the first gap and wait for the mine to pass and 
                head east, follow it and run in between the two pillars, 
                then wait for it to pass heading the opposite way and 
                run to the other side of the pillar, where you can now 
                easily make your way from gap to gap to the end of the 
                room (be patient on the last line of mines, as one of 
                them moves faster, so you may have to wait for the timing
                to become right).
	5: Floating Mine x8; Rifle Bullets x5
                Now it gets more fun here.  Head to the first gap, then 
                head across to the second gap.  Now you can go either 
                left our right when you do this, either way, wait for 
                the second mine to head away from you, then run as fast 
                as possible into the gap between the pillars, then when
                the second mine is out of sight (which will be immediately
                once you get in between the pillars) head onto the other 
                side of the pillar to the east wall (door in this case), 
                then you're pretty much home free to do what you've
                practiced and get across to the opposite hall while
                avoiding mines.  The last two mines are fairly challenging
                however, and I haven’t been able to get past them without
                getting blown up by one of them, so do your best and run
                at just the right time and you might make it, if not,
                you should be blown into a corner that the other mine can't
                reach, and you'll be able to continue on in peace...es.

	Head down the hall past the...
Level 1 - Machine Gun Bullets x150
Level 2 - Machine Gun Bullets x125
Level 3 - Machine Gun Bullets x100
Level 4 - Machine Gun Bullets x75
Level 5 - Machine Gun Bullets x25

	Then continue down the hall into what I'm going to call a room... 
even though it's a hall.

Room 3 - Level...

	1: Deepground Soldier x1; X-Potion x1
                Just kill the soldier like you did in room 1, nice and 
                easy... head on.
	2: Deepground Soldier x1; Mega-Potion x1
                Repeat the process that you did in level 1... yay...
	3: Deepground Soldier x2; Hi-Potion x1
                Do exactly what you did in level 2 & 1, except twice... 
                there nicely lined up for you, so no worries.
	4: Deepground Soldier x2; Vital Rations x1
                Repeat level 3's instructions... there's a lot of 
                backtracking for this rooms guide.
	5: Deepground Rocketeer x3; Potoin x1
                Run back and forth in and out of the door way making 
                sure not to get hit by any rockets and taking quick shots 
                on the nicely lined men until they're all dead.

	Follow the hall, past all the windows until you come to a door on 
your right hand side, go into...

Room 4 - Level... (the numbers may vary for each of the four separate 
rooms in this area)

	1: Gargoyle x1
                You have to go through four of these rooms, so it's 
                really four gargoyles, but that's alright, for now, 
                it's easy just kill the gargoyle floating around, or if 
                you don't want to waste the ammo, you can just run on to 
                the next room just as easy.  Just make sure you jump a lot 
                when your heading down the windowed hall on the other side.
	2: Gargoyle x2 
                For the most part, just kill the gargoyle's that get in 
                your way, and don't worry about any that are somewhere 
                else in the room... unless of course, you want to kill them.
                Continue jumping when you're running down the hall though, 
                and do it for all the other level's so I don't have to repeat 
                this.
	3: Gargoyle x2; Turk Robot x1
                Whatever you do, don't shoot the Turk, leave him alone, he 
                leaves you alone.  Forgetting about the Turk's, all you need 
                to is repeat what you did in level 2, just with extra caution 
                to avoid the Turk's.
	4: Gargoyle x3; Turk Robot x1 (only two gargoyles in the other 
three rooms)
                Again, don't hurt the Turk, or else the Turk hurts you.  Now 
                you have 3 gargoyles to deal with, so just take out any that 
                get in your way again, which will probably be two, and for the 
                first room, take the long way around so you can avoid the Turk, 
                and in the third room, make sure you're careful not to hit the 
                Turk when you're about to go into the fourth room.
	5: Gargoyle x3; Turk Robot x2 (one less gargoyle in the other 
three rooms, hard to tell though)
                Now it becomes a hassle to avoid the Turk's, but it's well worth
                your time.  For the first two rooms, you're going to have to 
                take the long way to get around and avoid the Turk's, but do so 
                anyways.  You'll probably leave the most gargoyles alive then 
                you ever have so far this time around, but don't worry, as long 
                as you jump around a lot when you're running away.

	Head down the hall jumping up as much as you can to avoid any 
more gargoyle attacks, once you make it into a room with boxes, you can 
stop jumping.  Head through the door and down the hall into...

Room 5 - Level...

	1: Deepground Soldier x3; Elixir x1; Red Potion x1
                Nice and easy, once will spawn in front of you, another to 
                your right, and another to your left, just take them out, 
                grab anything you want, and head on.
	2: Deepground Soldier x3; Limit Breaker x1; Red Potion x1
                Again, only three guys, kill them the same way you did the
                first time.
	3: Deepground Soldier x3; Ether x1; Red Potion x1
                Only three soldiers again, kill them like you did in levels
                1 & 2.
	4: Deepground Soldier x3; Spirit Rations x1; Red Potion x1
                Once again, only three... you know what to do.
	5: Deepground Soldier x3; Potoin x1; Potoin x1
                For the last time, only three soldiers...

	Once out of there, head down the hall and into a room with boxes 
to find a little item area to your left with...
Level 1 - Potoin x1
Level 2 - Potoin x1
Level 3 - Potoin x1
Level 4 - Cait Sith in a Supply Box
Level 5 - Nothing

	On the opposite side of the room is...

Room 6 - Level...

	1: Floating Mine x1; Fire Materia
                Nice and easy, use the alcoves on the sides to avoid the 
                mine as it passes down the hall and get to the other side 
                and...
	2: Floating Mine x3
                There are two easily seeable mines when you first walk in, 
                and one in the back left alcove, so make sure you remember 
                that.  It doesn't get too hard yet though, just use the 
                alcoves and wait for the mines to pass, then run to the 
                next alcove until you make it to the other side.
	3: Floating Mine x4
                Now only the alcoves on the right are safe, to walk along, 
                so only use the left ones to stand in the gap, but don't 
                go into the halls that they lead to.  Run back and forth 
                avoiding the mines in the center and get to the end of 
                the hallway.
	4: Floating Mine x4
                Now instead of the first mine being on the left side, it's 
                switched to the right side, so keep that in mind and repeat 
                the steps for level 3 to get to the end.
	5: Floating Mine x6; Deepground Rocketeer x1
                Last room, now there's two mines in the middle, and four in 
                the side alcoves.  As you walk in, make the rocketeer your 
                top priority, avoiding the mine that may come at you when 
                doing so by just standing in the doorway and moving out of 
                the way if it gets too close.  Once the rocketeer's gone, 
                just run back and forth dodging the mines in the center, and 
                only using the gaps and you won't have to worry about the 
                other four mines.  Just keep going back and forth until you 
                get to the gate and WIN!

	Head out and past the elevator to head onto the next level (if 
you didn't win here, go back up to the top and repeat the process 
corresponding the number with what level your on).

My Best Time: 13:06

==================================

This mission is really just another kill 100 enemies with only melee... 
except you can shoot and use magic... but for almost everything, you're 
meleeing.  The explosive barrels can be nice, but they are also the 
worst thing around, because of the explosions gigantic radius, you 
might want to make sure your clear of the area when you shoot a barrel.  
Also, the Elite Soldiers guns do almost nothing in comparison to the 
normal gun that would be shot at you, so you really don't have much to 
worry about.

	In the beginning, one guy will spawn... then two guys... then 
three guys, etc.  The spawning will go by areas, so if things die down, 
then head onto sector 'C' and more enemies will begin spawning again.  
Resume your normal butt kicking until they’re no one spawning any more, 
then head onto sector 'A' and you'll finish things off there and in 
between A and B.  At the end, you don't have to fret too much, when 
you're standing by the stairs and lots of guys spawn and start shooting 
you, you can just stand there and watch how slowly your health will go 
down... so don't worry.  Also, there's Limit Breakers all over the map, 
so if you need health, just use one.  Lastly, ammo will spawn randomly 
every where, which I don't really get since shooting will do nothing 
for you, but just in case...

My Best Time: 0:17

==================================

I thought this map was rather easy, but that's because I ended up 
getting the last shot in right as I would have died, but ended up 
winning instead.  Really just shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot and you should 
make it out alive.  I think it would have been better if they had maybe 
given you some potions and made you have to kill all four individually, 
instead of just killing one.

	When you start out, just choose one of the Black Widow's and 
start shooting.  To avoid the beams, run back and forth, going north to 
south doing periodic double jumps (if you want to, but you'll still 
avoid the beams if you don't) over and over again, you shouldn't get 
hit once... it might be close though.  They die pretty fast, so just 
shoot and shoot and they'll be dead before you know it.

My Best Time: 14:08

==================================

This level seemed impossible when I first began playing, I couldn't get 
past 30 EX Medals without running out of ammo and having to bash people 
to death... which takes a loooong time by the way.  But then I hit one 
of the red crates for the millionth time and Vuala! out popped a 
Gatling Gun!  I was wondering why they had named the level so and not 
had any Gatling Gun... any ways, upon destroying one of the red crates 
(I'm not sure what method of destruction you might have to use, I 
always just bashed them) a Gatling Gun will spawn, making the level in 
fact possible, and more so, easy.  

If you get the capsule, unlock the 38th mission and beat it, a gatling
gun will spawn in the red crates.  They will not spawn until you have
done so.
Thank you stuffmatters247@hotmail.com for this!

There's between a 25-50% chance of 
having the guy you kill drop an EX Medal, and I'll tell you my strategy 
in the next paragraph, for now, just know that you start out having to 
fight the flying Soldiers (some that only stay on the ground, and some 
that literally fly) then around 25+ medals, gargoyles begin spawning, 
and there are some gargoyles that will stay on the ground, and some 
that like to fly even higher then the soldiers, so once gargoyles begin 
spawning, make sure to check way above often.

Here's my guessed chance of what someone will drop:
	50%	Nothing
	40%	Mini EX Medal	Worth 1 point.
	5%	Gigas EX Medal	Worth 3 points.
	4%	Hi-Potion
	1%	Ether

	Well, start out by going around and bashing all the red crates 
(restart if none of them have a Gatling Gun) until a Gatling Gun 
spawns, hop in it and take out anyone that comes.  You're pretty much 
invincible in a Gatling gun as you have increased defense (so much that 
you can't get hurt) and a super powerful weapon that will kill anyone 
in your way with 9999 damage.  And you can take your time because (from 
what I've seen anyway) the EX Medals don't disappear, so only take a 
few times to get off and grab the medals, then hope right back on and 
start shooting again.  Upon collecting 100 medals, level 39 opens.

Lastly, I decided to put all the red crates whereabouts, just to be 
helpful:
	H-9	On top of the board leading across two trains.
	H-12	Sitting between some trains, a tower and some crates.
	L-9	On top of a cart.
	F-10	On top of some large crates.
	G-6	Behind some barrels and a train.

My Best Time: 1:55

==================================

I thought this mission was very easy, you get more than enough ammo, 
WAY more time than you need, and everyone dies in one or two shots and 
the creatures respawn back up at the top if you miss them...

	All you really need to do is go stand in front of the water fall 
and look downstream, at first, Red Saucers will come, upon killing ten 
of them Sahagin's will begin appearing.  The Sahagin’s are just as easy 
as the Red Saucers, except they're bigger... which I would imagine 
would make it even easier.  Once ten Sahagin's die, Cactuars come.  
These guys are the fastest, and smallest of the bunch, but are still 
very easy to kill, so don't worry, sit back and take out ten of these 
guys to make a final total of 30 kills... and you're done!  That's IT! 
I'm not kidding too...

Sigh, if you though Red and Blue was easy, then you'll find this one 
just as easy.  Sadly, they both have very little health, so you don't 
even have to worry about your own life...

	Just start firing away at anyone that comes close, jumping around 
a lot will help you dodge Weiss, and Nero just doesn't really attack 
much, and when he does, its not all that painful... if you need any 
additional help, email me I guess.

My Best Time: 2:30

==================================

This mission is very easy if you keep on your toes, but if you let the 
soldiers turn super, you'll have to work hard to finish them off.  
There's a random chance (except for the ten soldiers at the end) that 
when you've killed a soldier, they'll turn super and move really fast 
and have really high defense, but they take a second to change, so if 
you shoot at them while they're transforming, they'll be dead before 
they can move, if you don't, then you have to fight against a really 
fast, high defense person ^_^.

	Start by running down the walkway, weaving your way around the 
pillars, taking out any soldier that spawns, and freaking out and 
shooting repeatedly anyone that glows orange.  After that, walk along 
the broken pathway for three more guys to do the same to.  Then head 
through the now open path and towards the blue gate, two guys spawn, 
kill them, then head up the stairs and kill all the soldiers on the 
next two platforms.  Then jump off at the top (here's where you can get 
the capsule) and head onwards along the walkway.  Kill all that spawn 
and extra kill all that try to go super.  Head up the stairs and kill 
everyone that spawns as you make your way back across the walkway (also 
a last guy on the left through the blue gate).  Walk through the newly 
opened gate and head over to the stairs, wait for all ten soldiers to 
spawn, then shoot the barrel in the middle, then start shooting at all 
ten of the guys who will begin turning super.  Upon finishing this, 
you'll have won the level!

==================================

This mission is rather easy, except that the Dual Horn will hit you 
repeatedly if you get stuck anywhere, and it's pretty much bye bye to 
you if that happens.

	Alright, the Dual Horn can't get hurt by your attacks, so instead 
you've got to lure it to an explosive barrel by running past the 
barrel, turning around at a safe distance, aim at the barrel and wait 
for the Dual Horn to get close, then BLAM! 900 damage!  Keep doing 
this... and try not to fall down the ledge, as it's hard and very 
painful to get back up... at least if you take the ladder.  So there's 
not much else to say about this level, you can see the barrels 
everywhere, and because of such, I'd recommend not using any of the 
barrels near corners, as you don't want to get yourself stuck.  Then 
just keep it up until he's dead.

This level is looooooooong and has two purposes to it, to make you hate 
Dual Horns, and make you LOVE Cait Sith's (probably so you aren't so 
angry with the fact that the next level involves killing Weiss with 
Cait Sith).  You have to kill 100 Dual Horn's (one of them being Arch 
Azul if you free Shelke).  Each Dual Horn will also drop a Gigas EX 
Medal which you can use to go "buy" yourself something... I'll list all 
the jukeboxes and what they give you in a moment.  This level will also 
get easier as you go on, as you get more stuff and can kill the Dual 
Horn's a lot faster... but it still takes a long while.  What really 
sucks is if you get pretty far in and then die, so just... don't die.

The Jukeboxes:
        Location        Cost            What you get
        ------------------------------------
        B-10            2 Coins	        A Cait Sith that will spawn 
                                        you items every once in a while.

        G-10            2 Coins	        Raises your maximum health (max 
                                        of 3000).

        D-6             3 Coins	        The Ultima Weapon Handle.

        G-5             3 Coins	        A Cait Sith that will attack the 
                                        Dual Horns for 500 damage per 
                                        attack.

        K-10            4 Coins	        A Cait Sith that will attack 
                                        the Dual Horns for anywhere between 
                                        100 and 1200 damage.

        N-8             7 Coins	        Spawns Shelke, take her to Shalua
                                        to get a manasoul. 
                                        (Thanks stuffmatters@homtail.com)

        K-6             8 Coins	        Give you the power of Chaos 
                                        (you'll move faster) for the rest 
                                        of the level.

        I-8             10 Coins	Calls in an air strike, a plane 
                                        will come in and shoot missiles 
                                        all over the map causing 9999 
                                        damage to anything it hits (I 
                                        never tried it on myself), best 
                                        to use this when you have a lot 
                                        of Dual Horns after you and not 
                                        just a few.

Also, Cait Sith will drop:
	Machine Gun Ammo x240
	Handgun Ammo x144
	Rifle Ammo x
	Potion x1
	Hi-Potion x1
	Ether x1
	Elixir x1

	Well, when you start, Shalua, if talked to, will give you a 
cardkey and three Gigas EX Medals to start you off, use them to get the 
Cait Sith in the jukebox right by you so you can begin having a supply 
of ammo to fight the Dual Horn's with.  I wouldn't ever recommend 
getting the Ultima Weapon at D-6, it's just not worth it.  I would go 
through a long explanation of how many guys come, and when, etc. but it 
would be a waste of everyone’s time, so I'm just gonna shorten things 
into what you should know.  Of course, as you go on, more and more Dual 
Horn's will enter the arena, but don't be frightened at first when you 
walk about 1/4 of the way down the level and all the Dual Horn's 
suddenly come up and loom over the edge, they'll only come a few at a 
time for a while.  Once you get to about 30 kills go and grab Shelke 
and spawn Azul, then run to the air strike jukebox at I-8 (hope you 
saved up for it) and use it to take a lot of them out.  When there's a 
big group you can either do the air strike, run around waiting for the 
Cait Sith's to kill all the Dual Horn's while you make circles and take 
shots at them, or use a Limit Breaker and run in and melee, melee, fall 
down, melee (make sure you press jump right as you're hitting the 
ground when you fall down so you get right back up).  Do this for 30-40 
minutes and you'll have this level made.

==================================

Yet another Cait Sith level, good thing, this is the last one.  You 
must now kill Weiss with the Cait Sith you came to love from the last 
level... ugn.  Some things about Weiss: he's much faster than any of 
the other bosses you've had to defeat using Cait Sith; he doesn't hurt 
as bad as the other bosses; he'll take nice long breaks sometimes, at 
which you can sit and beat up on him.

I'm going to list his attacks:

	Normal Attack:
		Weiss will run up to you and make a quick slash at you.
		About 100 damage.
		This is probably the second hardest attack to dodge, just 
                jump away from him, and if you get the right timing, he'll 
                miss.

	Gun Shot:
		Weiss will point his sword at you and let a few shots 
                loose.
		(Don't know, I couldn't get Weiss to hit me with this)
		I can't even get Weiss to hit me with this attack, just 
                stay out of his direct line of vision and you'll miss it 
                by a long shot.

	Speed Attack:
		Weiss will fly across the level in different directions a 
                few times.
		About 50-100 damage.
		This one can really only be dodged by luck.

	Circle Speed Attack:
		Weiss will fly around the arena in a closing circle.
		About 50-100 damage.
		Start by standing in the inside when you notice he's doing 
                this, then run to the outer edge and wait for him to finish.

	Dual Image:
		Weiss will create two 'clones' of himself, the 'clones' and 
                Weiss will then come at you.
		About 200-300 damage.
		The hardest attack to dodge, I've only done it once, and 
                that was lucky.  Just try your best to jump away from the 
                attack, if you have problems dodging this, you're not alone.

And the 300hp healing moogles:
	I-9		In the little Alcove in the wall.
	I-8		By an opening.
	J-8		Behind the blue pillar.
	K-7		By an opening (opposite of the I-8 moogle).

	Sigh*, what else can I say, run out into the field, Weiss will 
spawn, use the dodging tactics shown above to get out of the way, make 
good use of your moogles, don't be afraid to get hit, because it's very 
hard to attack him and not get attacked back and wait for his stall 
periods as often as you can to keep yourself alive and to get nice 
free, full combo shots on him.  This level really isn't that hard once 
you get the hang of Weiss' attacks.

No items, no extra things, just whatever you start with and 4 bosses to 
fight against... but like all the re-inaction of the boss fights, they 
all have a low amount of health, making them significantly easier.

	Run into the arena and start shooting like you did for all the 
other boss battles.  Jump away from Weiss' attacks and take quick shots 
on him like you did with Cait Sith, just charge at Rosso and Azul until 
they're dead, and run in circles while shooting at Nero to finish him 
off (I actually killed them by getting Rosso out of my hair first, then 
Nero, then Azul and ending with Weiss) but just kill anyone who suits 
your fancy (Weiss would probably be best to kill first if you're having 
troubles staying alive).  Yay, only two more levels to go!

Ahh, the last 'real' level, the level after this is just a side mission 
maze, so I consider this the real last level.  And of course, all last 
level's should be hard!  Thankfully, Square Enix didn't fail in that 
aspect.  Though, I think I'd actually rate this level with a 4, I'll 
give it a 5 just because...  Alright, this level is basically just 
making your way throughout the entire structure fighting enemies on 
your way through. Here we go!

Sector 1:
	You begin with having to fight off 3 Black Widow's, this is 
fairly easy though if you just learn to use the pillars as blockades 
for the missiles, you should receive minimal damage.  Once you're 
finished with that, head not towards any of the blue gates but instead 
head to a ramp across from the blue gate, it leads up to a structure, 
watch out for the many mines that litter the way up to the building, if 
I counted correctly, there are 12 mines in total. 4 up the ramp, 2 at 
the top of the ramp, 2 around the corner to the left, 3 in front of the 
building and 1 inside.  Inside the building is a red box that contains 
a Cait Sith (who believe makes the level much too easy but the levels 
practically impossible without him), and a Limit Breaker and Materia 
Recharger are behind the crate.  Make you're way back out and head back 
towards where you spawned (so not the gate that's directly in front of 
you when you're coming down the ramp) and head through the gate at the 
base of that ramp (it's on the western side of the sector) and head 
into the extra sector.

Extra Sector:
	In here, there are 9 really strong guys (Elite Soldiers) that 
hurt like crazy if they even take one shot at you with their machine 
guns.  There are three of them at the base of the fortress, one guy 
that walks along the edge if you look up after killing the first three, 
and two more by the top or along the ramp leading up to the building.  
Then two more will come at you sometime during your trek up to the 
building, and the final one will come out of the building as you near 
the front door.  Inside are some goodies that have things like a 
Phoenix Down and Ether, etc.  Now head back down and through the blue 
gate on the other side of sector 1.

Sector 2:
	Now I thought this was pretty hard... at least before I knew 
about Cait Sith... anyways, jump onto the Gatling Gun once you're all 
stocked up and ready to go and look one level below you, across the 
hole.  Two Gatling Guns will appear on either side of the pillar, and 
starting with the right gun (and going back and forth, left to right), 
one by one a soldier will run up to the gun and get in and start 
shooting at you, you're job is to kill all twenty (10 on each side) 
before getting there, but it's really easy because they only come one 
at a time, the only problem is if you get behind.  After killing all 
twenty, don't get out, instead sit and guard the right side, as a new 
gun will spawn up over there, now you have to cover three guns and take 
out the rocketeers that spawn on the level above them.  Once again, the 
soldiers will spawn from right, to left, then spawn on the right again, 
except now a little faster to compensate for the new turret.  And 
whenever you can, take quick shots at the rocketeers on the upper 
level.  After finishing all 40 off, you can head on.

Sector 3:
	Now to re-enact the extra cactuar level, one of the crates holds 
the cardkey, but which one?  Just shoot the box and keep shooting until 
whatever in it is dead or you find out it is the cardkey inside.  
You'll either see a Black Widow or some kind of rank of soldier 
(including one on a Gatling Gun) inside the boxes, just to keep you 
prepared.  Once you get lucky enough to get the cardkey, go to the next 
sector.

Sector 4:
	Go jump off the water fall to the left and get up onto the 
construct.  Now watch the waterfall, a total of 10 soldiers will fall 
from the top, just shot anyone that comes down, then head into the 
underground floor.  Here you will now need to get your kills up to 20.  
And you have to do it by killing rocketeers!  Ten rocketeers will spawn 
at different times, just kill them as they come in, it only gets bad if 
one of them hits you, because then they all get to take a shot on you 
xD.

Sector 5:
	Now it's time to do some sniping... or to be sniped.  There are 
12 snipers waiting somewhere along the 4 different levels of the 
construct, so just run around (or sneak around) until you get shot at 
or see someone (there's also 1 guy on the first floor to the right of 
where you came in by the gate around the corner), and if you get stuck 
at ten guys, try aiming you reticule at the glass walkways on the 
fourth floor and you'll find there are two guys on either side shooting 
at you through the walkway.  Once you've finished them off, you're not 
done yet, now you must face off with all the main bosses... and then 
some.  First it's Rosso.  Jump around and back peddle a lot while 
taking shots and you shouldn't have a problem (ugn, they need to give 
these bosses more health).

Sector 6:
	Nero wants a fight with you now, if you just pull out a handgun 
or something you can finish him off before he can even attack (what I 
did), if you can't, then just charge him, since he's a long range 
character and shoot and shoot and shoot 'till he's dead... I don't know 
what else to say.

Sector 7:
	Now it's Azul's turn to take a shot at you.  Because he's so big 
and painful, you're just gonna want to back peddle and shoot, you 
shouldn't have any problem avoiding anything however, due to how slow 
he is.  Once you've taken him out, it's time for Weiss.

Sector 8:
	As I said before, Weiss's turn, and you get to fight him in the 
confines of the tiny little hall... yay!  With Weiss' quick and spacey 
attacks, the fact you're in a hall makes him very hard to dodge, so 
expect to get mowed over a few times, but for the most part, just keep 
out of his way and shoot, using all your knowledge about Weiss and his 
attacks to take him out.  Only one guy left to go.

Sector 9:
	Of course, Chaos, should've known.  I had no problems whatsoever 
on this battle due to the fact that Chaos decided to attack Cait Sith 
the entire time and let me just sit there and shoot him.  Because of 
that, I have to earthly idea what he might be like to go up against.  
I'd imagine you'd want to stay as far away from this fast moving 
character as possible, and make sure to be ready for any shot that 
might come out of his deadly gun.. all in all however, his health is 
low enough you should be able to finish him off quickly enough so you 
won't have to worry about getting beaten around too much.

YAY! Now you’re only got level 46 to go and you've finished 'em all!

LAST LEVEL! Please try to do this one on your own, as it's fun, and the 
only thing this guide will do is ruin that fun.  If you've decided to 
skip that warning, then here I go.  This level is about getting through 
a maze of 'invisible walls' or gates to be more specific.  I'm going to 
put the locations of all the medals for your convenience:

	H-4	Under the stairs.
	G-5	In a box of gates by the starting.
	G-4	At the top center of the main stairway.
	F-6	Behind some crates in the room to the west of the starting.
	F-6	In some gates that has two cardkeys, jump on the crates on 
the outside to get in.
	G-5	Under the main stairs, you have to use the cardkey from F-6 
to get in from the southern side.
	F-4	On top of some crates.
	G-4	In between two gates (one of which you can jump over to get 
in) in the main hall.
	H-6	Behind some crates in a floating cargo box.
	H-5	Behind some crates in a floating explosive barrel.

So with that said, I'm now going to have to come up with an easy way to 
tell you how to get through the maze... hmmm... let me try ASCII art 
(beware, I'm not that great)... this is a map of the rooms without the 
pass through able gates:

Room 3 and the balcony I'm not going to draw out because there are no 
passable walls there.

Hopefully this gave you some help one how these rooms work, if not, I'm 
now going to go through a step by step procedure on how to get all the 
medals.

	Run out from the starting hall and make an immediate turn right, 
head along the fences until you can't go foreword any more, turn left 
and head towards the stairs, but turn right once you get up to them, 
then make another turn right and head down into the sideways doorway 
and get the medal in the cargo behind the crates.  Go out and turn left 
into the hallway.  Follow the hallway into a room on the left, shoot 
the barrel behind the crates and grab that medal.  Now head back into 
the first room.  Head right up to the stairs, then left, then turn 
right so you're standing at the base of the stairs, but go a little 
past the base and make a turn right and grab the medal under the 
stairs.  Turn around and instead of taking a left towards the stairs, 
go right (north) through the gate, then make a left turn around the 
gate and go through the gate directly in front of you, take a left and 
grab the medal, then head back to the last gate you walked through and 
turn right and head down until you hit a gate, turn right then left, 
then make another right through the gate, go forewords and left through 
the gates in front of you, then forewords and right through those two 
gates and grab the medal.  Turn around and head back to the base of the 
stairs, this time go up them, grab the medal at the top and jump off on 
the other side to the southern (left) side of the gate below you, or 
else you'll have to run all the way around again.  Now run into the 
room directly in front of you (the one with the sideways doorway) and 
grab the medal behind the crates, then jump on top of the crates and 
into the fence box.  Use the cardkey to get out and head out of the 
room and down the hallway to the left.  Once you're in the last room 
(room 2 on the map), head right all the way to the wall, then walk 
through the next to gates in front of you, then turn left and make your 
way to the dinning table, go around it (through the two gates) and head 
all the way back to the other side of the room, jump on the stack of 
crates and grab the item to get over the fence.  To you're left is a 
medal on top of some crates, and if you turn to the right around the 
fence, you head into a hallway of 3 passable gates and one gate you 
must jump over to grab the final medal.  YAY! You're done with all the 
Extra Missions! Congratulations!

	Everything was written solely by me, Mark.  I went through every 
level and located each capsule, used the games resources to get the 
mission briefings and starting ammo/health.  I gave all of my best 
times to give you something to beat or help you in any other way, I 
went through each level at least three times, and some up to seven 
times, to get all the information as accurate as possible and to give 
my understanding of the level's difficulty, and I went through each 
level and gave a my own description/notes and guide on how to get 
through the level.  Everything is in my own words except some of the 
mission briefings given, from which, credit to whom I may have gotten 
the information will be given.

Thanks to:
	Square Enix       -For the game and most of the mission 
                           briefings.
	sephirosuy        -For help on some of the levels that I got 
                           stuck on.
	4tonMANTIS        -For being cool
	lifelessdummy     -For helping me to find a large percentage of 
                           the capsules (I'm lazy sometimes).

        stuffmatters247@hotmail.com; nmj7towa@hotmail.com; adhvt@hotmail.com
        for many answers to questions and contributions to the guide.

	All my friends, even though they probably don't know even I'm 
                           making this guide... heh*
	And any sites this FAQ is posted on.

I will not post contact for anyone in the Thanks to section because I 
don't feel like emailing them and asking them if it's alright... they 
can be found, however, somewhere in GameFAQs (more easily found in the 
Dirge of Cerberus section) if you really need to contact them.

If you find anything wrong with this guide, find something missing, 
want to give me some tips on how to make it better/readable, need 
clarification on anything, or have any questions concerning anything 
about in the Extra Features, you can contact me at Utilael@aol.com 
(also given at the top).

What you should email me:
	Problems or things wrong with the FAQ, anything that may need 
correcting, fixing or clarification.  Anything that I might have 
forgoten to complete or left out.

What you shouldn't email me:
	Dumb questions or questions that have nothing to do with the 
Extra Missions.  Questions that will not help me with this FAQ (e.g. 
'Where is the capsule on level 21?' instead say, 'I believe the capsule 
location on level 21 is incorrect' and if you know where it actually 
is, tell me).

~And thanks to you for reading this!
