Now that the BMG weighs in at over 750 K, the easiest way to find what you want
will be to use the Find or Search feature in your web browser or text editor.
Search for terms within [square brackets] to skip directly to the section you
want:

- A section number within [square brackets] jumps you immediately to
  that section
- The name of an action, reaction, support, or move ability, status
  ailment, command set, or class within [square brackets] brings
  you directly to detailed information about your search term

This is probably one of the very last updates to the BMG. It's been great fun
researching, writing, and updating it over the past 6 years. Thanks so much to
everyone on the GameFAQs boards for urging me to update, and thanks also to 
Ben Siron, who wrote a similar 'handbook' for Final Fantasy IV that inspired 
me to make the BMG in the first place. Peace to all, and enjoy!

                            *** NEW IN VERSION 6.5 ***

- Rewrote gameflow section, reorganizing the clocktick and reworking the
  mechanics of Quick
- Revised durations of status effects to match new gameflow theory
- Added section 2.8 on MIMIC
- Fixed elemental parts of damage/success rate modification algorithms in
  parts 2 and 3

TO SKIP TO A SECTION: Find (Ctrl + F) the number of the section between
brackets. For instance, if you wanted to skip to section 9.3, you would
Find "[9.3]" (without the quotes). (No, there is no 9.3. This is to prevent
you from finding this description when you search for a section number!)

[1.1] definitions             
      =========================================================================
                              
Here are a few definitions of terms that will recur throughout the rest of the
guide.                        
                              
- A UNIT is any person or monster on the battlefield.
                              
- An attack (lowercase) is any action taken by a unit in battle except for 
  'Move', 'Defend', 'Wait', or 'Equip Change'. ATTACK, in uppercase, refers
  to the specific command ATTACK.

- The CASTER is the unit executing an attack. This doesn't necessarily have 
  to refer to spells: a unit striking another with a sword is a 'caster' as 
  well. 

- The TARGET is the unit(s) on the receiving end of the attack.
  The caster and target can be the same unit.

- DAMAGE is loss of HP or MP. Unless otherwise stated, assume that the term 
  'damage' refers to HP damage.

- An EFFECTIVE stat is one that is not actually displayed on the status screen 
  in the game, but is used internally by the game for calculation of the 
  formula it appears in.

- PHYSICAL ATTACKING ABILITY (PA) is the number next to the sword icon on the
  middle panel of the status screen. A unit can have a PA no less than 1 and 
  no greater than 99. Note: although displayed PA must be 99 or less, 
  effective PA can be greater than 99.

- MAGICAL ATTACKING ABILITY (MA) is the number next to the rod icon on the 
  middle panel of the status screen. Like PA, MA is bounded by 1 and 99,
  inclusive, but effective MA can in theory be greater than 99.
  
- CHARGE TIME (CT) is an indicator of a unit's readiness to act. A unit 
  receives an ACTIVE TURN (AT, or simply 'turn') when its CT is greater than 
  or equal to 100. On each AT, a unit can either move and act, move but not
  act, act but not move, or neither act nor move. At the end of the AT, CT
  is decremented according to what the unit did on its turn:
               move and act ........... new_CT = CT - 100
               move only .............. new_CT = CT - 80
               act only ............... new_CT = CT - 80
               neither act nor move ... new_CT = CT - 60
  If new_CT is greater than 60, it is instead set to 60.
              
- SPEED (Sp) determines how often a unit gets active turns. For each
  unit of FFT time (clocktick), each unit will gain an amount of
  CT equal to its Speed. A unit gets a turn on any clocktick where its
  CT is greater than or equal to 100. Speed also determines the strength
  of some physical attacks (such as THROW and STEAL) and determines the
  charging time for the JUMP attack. Maximum Speed is 50, but under normal
  playing conditions it won't usually exceed 20.
  
- WEAPON POWER (WP) is a property of weapons that determines their strength. 
  It can be seen on the middle panel of the status screen, next to the 
  letter of the appropriate hand ('R' or 'L'). 

- An ATTACK STAT (XA) is a general term that can stand for any 
  stat or combination of stats that influences the damage or success rate of
  an attack. It is used where the same formula applies to two or more types
  of attacks, but different stats are plugged into the formula for each 
  attack. For instance, swords and knight swords share the damage formula 
  of XA * WP, where the attack stat XA = PA for swords and 
  XA = [(PA * Br) / 100] for knight swords.

- A PHYSICAL ATTACK is one that meets at least ONE of the three following 
  criteria:
  (a) Damage or success rate is increased by the caster's
      having Attack UP
  (b) Damage or success rate is decreased by the target's
      having Defense UP or Protect status
  (c) Success rate is decreased by the target's physical evade.
  Note that an attack does not have to use PA in its damage or success
  formula in order to be a physical attack.

- A MAGICAL ATTACK is one that meets at least ONE of the three following 
  criteria:
  (a) Damage or success rate is increased by the caster's
      having Magic AttackUP
  (b) Damage or success rate is decreased by the target's
      having Magic DefendUP or Shell status.
  (c) Success rate is decreased by the target's magical evade.
  (In general, magical attacks that have beneficial effects, such as 
   Cure and Protect are not susceptible to Shell, Magic DefendUP, or 
   magic evade.)
  Note that not all attacks that use MA in their damage or success 
  formulas are magical attacks -- some are in fact physical!

- A NEUTRAL ATTACK is defined as one that is neither physical nor 
  magical. Examples include TALK SKILL, DANCE, SING, the DRAW OUT 
  ability 'Murasame', and the Bomb's 'Self-Destruct' command.

- A CLOCKTICK is the basic unit of time of an FFT battle.  During
  one clocktick, each unit's CT meter increases by an amount equal
  to the unit's Speed. Strictly, a clocktick is defined as the 
  period of time between two consecutive S+ phases (don't worry about
  this now; see the gameflow section, Appendix A, for details).

- A SLOW ACTION is any attack that requires a charging time between
  the time it is selected and the time when it is actually executed.

- CLOCKTICKS TILL RESOLUTION [CTR] is a value associated with each
  slow action that determines its charging time in clockticks. A
  slow action with CTR = 1 will be executed on the clocktick after
  it is initiated, and one with CTR = 2 will be executed on the
  second clocktick after it is initiated. CTR is related to the
  spell speeds given in the game as CTR = RU{100 / spellspeed}
  and spellspeed = RU{100 / CTR}. This guide uses CTR instead of
  spell speed because spell speed is problematic for some slow
  actions such as CHARGE, and CTR is the actual value stored by
  the game. See Appendix A for details.

- A FAST ACTION is any attack which is resolved immediately upon 
  selection.  See the gameflow section, Appendix A, for details.

- A REACTION is any attack immediately executed by the target of a 
  just-resolved slow action, fast action, or act of mimicry.  
  Reaction abilities cannot be reacted to or mimed. The nature of 
  the reaction is determined by a unit's reaction ability.

- BRAVE (Br), which is listed on-screen under the character's name 
  and occupation, is a stat that supposedly represents courage in
  battle. It's a factor in barehanded attacks, a few special skills
  and some weapon attacks, and also represents the rate at which 
  you'll use your reaction ability.  In this guide, you will see it
  abbreviated as 'Br'. Brave is on a scale from 0 to 100; if you
  fall below 10 Brave, you'll be afflicted with the Chicken status
  ailment. Any unit except for Ramza or Guests that has a permanent
  Brave of 5 or less at the end of a battle will leave the party.

- FAITH (Fa), listed on-screen next to Brave, is supposed to 
  represent belief in miracles and supernatural phenomena. It 
  factors into both magic damage and rate of success, and is an 
  important stat for a mage. Like Brave, it varies from 0 to 100.
  Any character except for Ramza or a Guest that has a permanent
  Faith of 94 or greater at the end of a battle will leave the 
  party.

- To ADD a status change is to cause a unit to be affected by that
  status change.

- To CANCEL a status change is to remove a status change that had 
  previously been added to a unit.
  
- To BLOCK a status change or element means that the status cannot
  be set on the blocking unit or that attacks bearing the element
  have a 0% success rate on the blocking unit. To inherently block
  a status or element is to be IMMUNE to that status or element.

- The RANGE of an attack is the number of squares, counted in a
  straight line, that the attack has the potential to target (not
  counting the caster himself). It is represented on the screen when 
  an attack is selected by red, glowing panels.  Examples:

  (X = Caster)
                            #           #
                  #        ###          #
        #        ###      #####         #
       #X#      ##X##    ###X###     ###X###
        #        ###      #####         #
                  #        ###          #
     Range 1   Range 2      #           #
                          Range 3     Range 3
                                     (4 directions)
    
    Usually, Range is independent of vertical height, but for some
    skills (e.g., TALK SKILL), it can be limited by height difference.
    If this is so, it will be noted in the guide with a "vX" after
    the range number, where X is the vertical tolerance of the attack
    in height units. For instance, the range of 'Threaten' is 3v2.
    
- The EFFECT AREA of an attack determines which panels will actually be
  hit by the attack. It's determined by counting the number of squares
  an attack can hit from the center to one corner of the effect area.
  Effect area is usually restricted by height. Height restrictions will 
  be noted in the guide with "vX" appended on to the effect number, with 
  X being the vertical tolerance of the attack in height units. For 
  instance, the effect area of 'Haste 2' is 2v3.

  Examples:
                           O
                 O        OOO
      O         OOO      OOOOO
                 O        OOO
                           O
   Effect 1   Effect 2  Effect 3

   A combination of range and effect area is used to determine the 
   attack's firing range. We represent this in the guide as two numbers,
   the first being the range and the second the effect area. For 
   instance, a spell with firing range {5/1} means it has a range of 5
   and an effect area of 1. If there is an effect area greater than one,
   it can make the attack go further than the range. 

   Special firing ranges:

   - for LINEAR firing ranges, the range is measured in the number of 
     directions the line can go in. The effect area is measured by 
     the number of squares it affects, and the number of directions 
     in which it does so. For example, the 'Holy Explosion' attack 
     is {4dir/5(1dir)}.

   - for AUTOMATIC firing ranges, the range and the effect area are
     always the same. This is denoted by {A/N}, where N is the 
     number of squares, in a straight line counted from the center 
     of the effect area, that the attack effects. For instance, {A/3} 
     is illustrated below. If the attack is helpful, the caster will
     usually also be targeted; if the attack is harmful, the caster
     will usually not be targeted. 

   X: caster
   #: panel in range
   O: affected panel

              O
             OOO          O                
             #O#          O                   O
      O     #####         O                  OOO
     #X#   ###X###     ###X###              OOXOO
      #     #####         #                  OOO
             ###          #                   O
              #           #                
     1/1     3/2    4directions/             A/3
                    3(1direction)    (caster may or may not
                                      be affected.)

- LINE-OF-SIGHT (LOS) means that the target of an attack must lie along
  a roughly linear path from the caster without any obstacles or other units
  intervening. For longbows, this path can be concave-down parabolic as well
  as linear (the arrow can arc). If an obstacle blocks the line of sight, a 
  line-of-sight attack will fail. If another unit blocks the line of sight, 
  the attack will be executed on the other unit instead of the intended 
  target. This can be used to your advantage with guns and bows to hit 
  targets that are closer than 3 panels (which can't normally be fired on):  
  target a panel directly behind the unit you want to hit, and since he 
  blocks your shot, you'll hit the intended target instead! Sometimes 
  this won't work with longbows because the arrow will arc over the 
  intervening target.

[1.2] abbreviations & symbols
      =========================================================================

Listed below are abbreviations and symbols, both mathematical and
game-related, that will be used throughout the guide.


MATHEMATICAL FUNCTIONS
----------------------

ARITHMETIC

We'll start with the basics:

+ means addition
- means subtraction
* means multiplication
/ means division

Division gets a little more complicated. The PSX doesn't have a floating
point unit, and so FFT uses integer division, meaning that it truncates all
remainders. To emphasize this, I place instances of division within square 
brackets:

                              [20 / 4] = 5
                              [21 / 4] = 5
                              [22 / 4] = 5
                              [23 / 4] = 5
                              [24 / 4] = 6

In other words, [x / y] means to divide x by y, keep the quotient and 
discard the remainder. Note that this differs from the greatest integer 
(floor) function in its treatment of negative numbers:  [-19 / 2] = -9 
while floor(-19 / 2) = -10. FFT uses truncation, not floor.

The symbol [x * y/z] is short-hand for [(x * y)/z].

In a few instances, the game will round the result of a division UP instead
of just dropping the remainder. To deal with this, I define the 'round-up 
division' function, RU{x / y} as follows:

                       RU{x / y} = [(x + y - 1) / y]

This is more intuitive if you think of it as dividing x by y and rounding up 
to the nearest integer. It's the same, trust me. :)

MAXIMUM & MINIMUM FUNCTIONS
max{x,y} = (x if x > y) or (y if y > x)
This function means to take whichever is largest of the two options separated
by the comma.

min{x,y} = (x if x < y) or (y if y < x)
Similarly, this means to take whichever is the smallest of the two options
in the brackets.

RANDOM NUMBER GENERATION
(x..y) means that the game generates a pseudo-random integer between x and y,
inclusive. I say 'pseudo' because no PSX random number generator is completely
random, and it's possible that there are biases. There hasn't been a lot of
study of this, though.

HEXADECIMAL
Where it is necessary for clarity, hexadecimal numbers are prefaced by a 
"$" character. So "$2710" means 2710 hex, or 10,000 decimal.

[1.3] signs of the zodiac
      =========================================================================

*******************************************************************************
For a very thorough discussion of Zodiac compatibility, including compatibility
charts for all the game's bosses, see A. Robinson's excellent Zodiac 
Compatibility Guide on GameFAQs.
*******************************************************************************

What would the Zodiac Brave Story be without Zodiac compatibility?  
Every unit in FFT has a Zodiac sign.  The interaction of the Zodiac signs 
is almost always an effect in damage calculation.  The few attacks which are
exempt from Zodiac compatibility include

     (1) Damaging attacks where the damage is based on the current
         or maximum values of HP and/or MP.  These attacks include
         the Bomb's 'Self-Destruct', the MAGIC SWORD attack 'Shock!',
         the Byblos' 'Shock', and the Archaic Demon's 'Lifebreak',
         among others.

     (2) The DRAW OUT attack Murasame, which restores (Caster's MA * 12) HP
         to all targets, regardless of Zodiac compatibility.  This is 
         probably a programming oversight.

In general, the better the compatibility, the higher the damage or the success 
rate of attacks exchanged between two units.

O: Neutral
+: Good   
-: Bad
?: Worst (same sex), Best (opposite sex), Bad (monsters)

In general, the last step of calculating the damage from an attack will
be multiplication. It is just before this final multiplication step that
zodiac modifiers are applied. One of the two multiplicands, which we'll
call XA, will be modified in the following way:

 'Neutral' compatibility:  XA_zodiac = XA
 'Good' compatibility:     XA_zodiac = XA + [XA / 4]
 'Best' compatibility:     XA_zodiac = XA + [XA / 2]
 'Bad' compatibility:      XA_zodiac = XA - [XA / 4]
 'Worst' compatibility:    XA_zodiac = XA - [XA / 2]

The stat or stats contributing to XA varies depending on the damage
formula for the attack. Zodiac modification is included in the detailed,
attack-specific damage modfication algorithms given in parts 2 and 3.

For attacks with a variable success rate, calculation of the success rate
usually involves addition. To get the full Zodiac effect on the success 
percentage, BOTH addends are affected in the way described above for XA, 
even though typically only one is stat-dependent. For instance, for the 
TALK SKILL Death Sentence, base success% = MA + 30. Against a target with
'Good' compatibility, success is equal to (MA + [MA/4]) + (30 + [30/4]), 
or (MA + [MA/4] + 37). Note that truncation applies twice, so the results 
can be slightly different than calculating (success% + [success% / 4]),
depending on the values of MA and of the attack-specific constant.

Variable success rate attacks are often subject to evasion as well.  An 
important thing to keep in mind is that ZODIAC COMPATIBILITY DOES NOT 
AFFECT EVASION; it can only affect the base success percentage of an attack.

Since monsters are unisex, they are immune from 'Best' and 'Worst' 
compatibility. So, for a monster, any unit that would normally be 'Best' 
or 'Worst' is instead 'Bad'.  NOTE -- some of the Lucavi beasts actually 
have their sex byte set to MALE and thus are not monsters even though they
appear to be:
                         Queklain ..... Male 
                         Velius ....... Monster
                         Zalera ....... Male
                         Adramelk ..... Monster
                         Hashmalum .... Male
                         Altima ....... Monster (both forms)
                         Elidibs ...... Monster               


_______________________________________________________________________________
[1.4] evasion 
      =========================================================================

When you attack a unit, it has a chance to dodge your attack with four 
parameters: (1) its class evasion (CEv); (2) its shield (SEv); (3) its 
accessory (AEv); (4) its weapon (WEv), if it has the reaction ability 
'Weapon Guard' set. There are separate categories for physical 
(P.SEv, P.AEv, P.CEv) and magical (M.SEv, M.AEv) evade. Note that there 
is no magical class evasion. Weapon evasion only works on physical attacks, 
and for the purpose of these equations, WEv = 0 unless the evading unit has
'Weapon Guard'.


EVADING PHYSICAL ATTACKS
------------------------

Physical attack evasion depends on the attacker's position relative to
the target.  These equations will produce a percentage from 0 to 100.
10^8 means 10 raised to the eighth power (= 100,000,000); 10^6 means 10
raised to the sixth power (= 1,000,000).

from front:  
hit% = [(base hit%)*(100-P.CEv)*(100-P.SEv)*(100-P.AEv)*(100-WEv) / (10^8)]

from side:   
hit% = [(base hit%) * (100-P.SEv) * (100-P.AEv) * (100-W.Ev) / (10^6)]

from rear:   
hit% = [(base hit%) * (100-P.AEv) / 100]

The above equations were designed with the constraints of FFT's math system
in mind. Since we are capable of noninteger division, it may be easier to
remove the final division by the large power of 10, and to think of each 
factor of (100 - P.xEv) as equivalent to (1 - P.xEv/100), in decimal
form. The result will come out the same as long as you truncate the decimal
left after the final multiplication.

- To determine whether an attack is subject to evade, check out the information
  for the attack in question in Part 2 or 3 of this guide.

- Unless it is otherwise noted, assume the base hit% is 100. For attacks with
  base hit% less than 100, the base hit% will be listed in the relevant section
  of part 2 or part 3 as "success%".

- Even if you fire BATTLE SKILL attacks out of a gun, they are still subject
  to evasion.

- MIGHTY SWORD has a 00% success rate if the target is not equipped with an 
  appropriate item for the Mighty Sword skill to break.  Consequently, all 
  monsters are unaffected by MIGHTY SWORD.

- What is considered the 'front', 'side', and 'back' can be confusing when
  dealing with ranged attacks like arrows and Wave Fist.  The following 
  diagram should help (thanks to Notti for giving me the idea to present 
  the information in this way).

 ___________________ 
|   |   |   |   |   |   If the target is standing on the panel marked 'X'   
| S | B | B | B | S |   and facing in the direction indicated by the arrow,
|___|___|___|___|___|   if you are attacking from a panel marked 'F', you
|   |   |   |   |   |   are considered to be attacking from the front; if
| S | S | B | S | S |   you attack from a panel marked 'S', the game
|___|___|___|___|___|   considers you to be attacking from the side; and
|   |   |  ||   |   |   if you attack from a panel marked 'B', you are
| S | S | Xv| S | S |   attacking from the rear.  Basically, the game
|___|___|___|___|___|   just decides whether your forward, sideways, or
|   |   |   |   |   |   behind distance from your opponent is greater, and
| S | F | F | F | S |   takes that to be your orientation.  In the event
|___|___|___|___|___|   of a tie, the foremost direction is the winner 
|   |   |   |   |   |   (front over side, side over back).  Note that this
| F | F | F | F | F |   is independent of the relative panel heights.
|___|___|___|___|___|  


EVADING MAGICAL ATTACKS
-----------------------

any position:  hit% = [(base hit%) * (100 - M.SEv) * (100 - M.AEv) / 10000]

This applies to most magic attacks, whether they are status-inducing 
or damage-causing. 

- A unit will not try to evade attacks that are curative or that
  add helpful status. See the tables in 3.3, 3.4, or 3.5 to determine
  whether a magic attack is subject to evade.

For an example of how evade percentages work (using the simplified 
versions of the equations that involve non-integer division), let's say 
Ramza attacks Algus -- who is equipped with a Crystal Shield (P.SEv +40%, 
M.SEv +15%) and an Elf Mantle (P.AEv +25%, M.AEv +25%) -- from the side. 
Inherent evade% (P.CEv) is ineffective from the side, but Algus' shield 
(P.SEv) and cloak (P.AEv) will give him a chance to avoid the damage:

               Orig%   Shield    Mantle
Ramza's hit% = [100 * (1-.40) * (1-.25)] = [100 * .6 * .75] = 45%.

And if Ramza now decides to cast Flare on Algus, Algus is also 
considerably protected due to M.SEv and M.AEv:

                     Shield    Mantle
Flare hit% = [100 * (1-.15) * (1-.25)] = [100 * .85 * .75] = [63.75] = 63%

If a target is somehow protected from a particular attack (for instance, 
if he has Rubber Shoes [block: Lightning] equipped and is targeted with 
Bolt 3, or is targeted with Seal Evil and is not undead), that attack will 
have a 00% success rate, regardless of zodiac sign, evasion multipliers, 
percentage multipliers, or anything else.

The reaction ability 'Abandon' causes all of a unit's evasion percentages
to be doubled for the entire battle (it does not require a trigger, despite
what the in-game description says). The 'Defending' status causes the same
effect temporarily.

If a target evades an attack due to its CEv, a 'Missed!' message will be
displayed. If a target evades an attack due to its AEv or SEv, a
'Guarded' message will be displayed. See section 6.12 for details.

As mentioned in the Zodiac section above, Zodiac compatibility has NO effect 
on evasion percentages.

For a list of SEv values for each shield, see section B.2. For a list of AEv
values for each mantle, see B.5.


_______________________________________________________________________________
[1.5] protect and shell
      =========================================================================

The 'Protect' and 'Shell' statuses can protect units from several attacks
in a variety of ways.  Here is a summary of the different types of defense
afforded by these statuses.

- If a physical attack does damage and the target has Protect, the attack stat
  (XA) in the damage equation will be modified such that new_XA = [XA * 2/3].
  If a physical attack inflicts a status, the XA in the success rate equation
  will be modified such that new_XA = [XA * 2/3]. If a physical attack
  causes damage calculated from the max or current HP of the target (e.g., 
  Mutilate), Protect will only affect the success rate of the attack, and
  not the damage.

- If a magical attack does damage and the target has Shell, the attack stat
  (XA) in the damage equation will be modified such that new_XA = [XA * 2/3].
  If a magical attack inflicts a status, the XA in the success rate equation
  will be modified such that new_XA = [XA * 2/3]. If a magical attack
  causes damage calculated from the max or current HP/MP of the target (e.g.,
  Demi, Demi 2, Life Drain, Spell Absorb, Gravi2, Lich), Shell will only
  affect the success rate of the attack, and not the damage.

Unlike Zodiac compatibility, Protect and Shell ONLY affect the XA for
variable success rate attacks -- not the entire percentage. Consequently,
with the exception of some (MA+K)%-based attacks of high-level monsters, 
Protect and Shell's effect on success rates of attacks is far less signficant 
than the effect of Zodiac compatibility.


_______________________________________________________________________________
[1.6] the elements
      =========================================================================

There are eight elemental properties in the game: Fire, Ice, Lightning, 
Water, Earth, Wind, Dark, and Holy.

In turn, there are two separate effects that can be caused by an elemental
attribute. They are (1) XA strengthening for a caster, and (2) damage 
modification for a target.

If the caster of an elemental spell has equipment endowed with 'Strengthen:
(element)', when he casts spells of that element, his strengthened_MA will
be equal to [MA * 5/4].  Note that this applies to the MA of the caster,
and not to the damage caused by the spell.  Though this will increase the 
damage of most spells (e.g., Fire 4, Shiva, Holy), if the spell normally does 
damage that is independent of MA (e.g., Lich), it will do no more damage 
from the 'Strengthen' effect (the success percentage, however, which does 
depend on MA, will be increased).  The 'Strengthen' bonus works the same for 
elemental weapons like Ice Brand and Holy Lance, except it is applied to
the appropriate attack stat(s) of the weapon (these are the values of XA
listed for each weapon in section 2.1).

The target of an elemental spell can have a variety of properties that
modify the actual DAMAGE dealt by the spells on that target (and not
the caster's MA):

'Weak: (Element)'  ... Damage from this element is doubled, even when
                       the amount of damage is unaffected by other types
                       of modifiers. In terms of the formula, the value of 
                       the NUMERATOR is multiplied by 2 just before the 
                       final division. Examples:               
                       - The damage equation for Fire 4 is 
                         damage = [(CFa * TFa * 32 * MA) / 10000]
                         If the target is weak against Fire, then this
                         becomes
                         damage = [(CFa * TFa * 32 * MA * 2) / 10000]
                       - The damage equation for Hurricane is
                         damage = RU{(Target's MaxHP) * 34 / 100}
                         If the target is weak against Wind, then this
                         becomes
                         damage = RU{((Target's MaxHP * 34 * 2) / 100}
                         and Hurricane will remove 68% of the target's HP
                         instead of 34%. Note that the success rate of 
                         Hurricane remains unchanged even when the target
                         is weak against Wind. 

'Half: (Element)'  ... Damage from this element is halved. This takes the
                       form of a factor of 2 inserted into the DENOMINATOR
                       before the final division. Examples:
                       - The damage equation for Dark Holy is
                         damage = [(CFa * TFa * 37 * MA) / 10000]
                         If the target is wearing an N-Kai Armlet (Half:
                         Dark), then the equation becomes
                         damage = [(CFa * TFa * 37 * MA) / 20000]
                       - Similarly, the normal formula for Lich is
                         damage = RU{(Target's MaxHP) * 50 / 100}
                         If the target has an N-Kai Armlet, this becomes
                         damage = RU{(Target's MaxHP) * 50 / 200}

'Cancel: (Element)' .. Attacks of this element cannot succeed (the 
                       prediction will just say 00%). To avoid a double
                       meaning for 'cancel', I use the word 'block' for 
                       this effect.

'Absorb: (Element)' .. Damage from element is added to, instead of 
                       subtracted from, the HP total.

Note that Weak, Half, Absorb and Cancel have no effect on the success
rates of elemental attacks.

For Geomancy, only MA is affected by elemental attributes, even
though PA is also used to calculate the damage.

The elemental affiliations of an attack are listed in its description 
(press SELECT), and also in the big list in section 3.3.

Example of elemental effects:

This example allows you to appreciate the subtle difference between the 
two kinds of elemental effects. Let's assume you have a Summoner with
20 MA and 70 Fa casting Lich on a target with 501 Max HP, neutral Zodiac 
compability and 60 Fa.  Lich does damage equal to RU{TargetMaxHP * 50/100} 
with a success rate of [(Caster Fa)*(Target Fa)*(MA+160) / 10000].  
Now envision some scenarios:

1.  Normal. Lich does RU{501 * 50/100} = 251 damage with a success rate
    of [70*60*180/10000] = 75%.

2.  The Summoner equips himself with 108 Gems, which strengthens Dark
    elemental. This means that wherever MA is considered, 
    new_MA = [MA * 5/4].  Because MA doesn't determine the damage done
    by Lich, the damage is unaffected, and remains at 251. The success
    rate, however, increases slightly, because new_MA = [20 * 5/4] = 25.
    So the success rate is now [70*60*185/10000] = 77%.

3.  Suppose the Summoner unequips the Gems, then the target equips himself 
    with an N-Kai Armlet, which has the property 'Half: Dark'. Since 
    'Half' affects damage itself and NOT MA directly, this time the damage 
    done by the spell will be affected, but the success rate will not. The 
    damage will now be equal to RU{TargetMaxHP * 50/200}, or 126. The 
    success rate, however, remains unaffected at 75%.

Weather-related effects on magic -- such as the strengthening of Lightning
during thunderstorms, the weakening of Fire during thunderstorms, and the
strengthening of Ice during snowstorms (see 6.5) -- are effects of the 
second type, influencing the actual damage done by the spell rather than 
the caster's MA.

Certain attacks -- such as ATTACK, CHARGE, BATTLE SKILL and HOLY SWORD 
directives -- are weapon-elemental, meaning they acquire the elemental 
properties of the weapon the caster is equipped with. If the caster's weapon 
has no elemental affiliation, weapon-elemental attacks will be non-elemental. 
In addition, physical attacks that are weapon-elemental only receive a bonus
from the 'Martial Arts' ability if the caster is barehanded.

[1.7] handling multiple instances of the same variable                
      =========================================================================

A number of multipliers can act on the variables you'll find in the equations 
throughout this guide.  In a few of these equations, the same variable appears 
twice; in these cases, it can be hard to determine where to apply the variable 
modifiers.  Usually only one instance of the variable is modified.  The list 
below shows these equations, with the modifiable variable marked with a "!".
(This applies for caluclating alterations from Zodiac as well.)

[2.1] attack
      =========================================================================
                             
The ATTACK directive is the most basic command in FFT. The following formulas 
prescribe how much damage an attack with a particular type of weapon can do.
This damage is subject to specific modifications that are detailed in the next
section. See section B.1 for a list of the values of WP for each weapon in the
game.

The ATTACK command is a weapon-elemental physical attack, unless it is 
executed with a magic gun, in which case it is a weapon-elemental MOD 5
magical attack (see section 3.2 for more details on this kind of attack).

Here is a list of the damage formulas and values of XA (for determining damage
modifiers) for all the different types of weapons. 

STRIKING WEAPONS | Range: 1v3 (from above) / 1v2 (from below)
===============================================================================
Bare Hands**...... damage = [(PA * Br) / 100] * PA    XA = [(PA * Br) / 100]
Knife ............ damage = [(PA + Sp) / 2] * WP      XA = [(PA + Sp) / 2]
Ninja Sword ...... damage = [(PA + Sp) / 2] * WP      XA = [(PA * Sp) / 2]
Sword ............ damage = PA * WP                   XA = PA
Knight Sword ..... damage = [(PA * Br) / 100] * WP    XA = [(PA * Br) / 100]
Katana ........... damage = [(PA * Br) / 100] * WP    XA = [(PA * Br) / 100]
Staff ............ damage = MA * WP                   XA = MA
Rod .............. damage = PA * WP                   XA = PA
Flail ............ damage = (1..PA) * WP              XA = (1..PA)
Axe .............. damage = (1..PA) * WP              XA = (1..PA)
Bag .............. damage = (1..PA) * WP              XA = (1..PA)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
** If a unit is barehanded, weapon-elemental attacks will receive the bonus
   from the Martial Arts support ability (they don't if the unit is equipped
   with any weapon -- see 6.2). For barehanded units, WP = 0 in any equations 
   that use WP (e.g., BATTLE SKILL success rate).


LUNGING WEAPONS  | Range: 2v3 (line of sight)
===============================================================================
Lunging weapons can only hit one unit at once -- if one unit is standing behind
another, and you are in front of them both and target the further unit, only 
the closer unit will be hit.
Spear ............ damage = PA * WP                   XA = PA
Stick ............ damage = MA * WP                   XA = MA
Cloth ............ damage = [(PA + MA) / 2] * WP      XA = [(PA + MA) / 2]


LONG-DISTANCE WEAPONS | Range: varies
===============================================================================
All long-distance weapons require a line of sight to be open between the 
attacker and the target. For longbows, this can also be a concave-down
parabolic path for the arrow to take rather than a direct line of sight. If
another unit intervenes in the line of sight between caster and target, that
unit will be hit instead. You can take advantage of this fact to shoot targets
closer than the minimum range.
                                                   RANGE
                                                  min max
                                                  --- ---
Crossbow ......... damage = PA * WP                3   4   XA = PA 
Longbow .......... damage = [(PA + Sp) / 2] * WP   3  ***  XA = [(PA + Sp) / 2]
Gun, physical**... damage = WP * WP                3   8   XA = WP
Musical Instrument damage = [(PA + MA) / 2] * WP   3   3   XA = [(PA + MA) / 2]
Dictionary ....... damage = [(PA + MA) / 2] * WP   3   3   XA = [(PA + MA) / 2]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**  Unlike with other weapons, ATTACKs with Guns are not subject to evasion.
*** Max longbow range is equal to 5 + [(Caster's Height - Target's Height) / 2]


MAGICAL GUNS | range: minimum 3, maximum 8 (line of sight)
===============================================================================
An ATTACK with a magical gun is the only time the ATTACK command is magical.
It's a MOD 5 magical attack (see section 3.2 for details) -- basically, a 
BLACK MAGIC spell with the WP of the magical gun substituted for MA:

                 damage = [(CFa * TFa * Q * WP) / 10000]

60% of the time, the magical gun will deliver a level 1 spell (Q = 14), 30% of
the time, it will deliver a level 2 spell (Q = 18), and 10% of the time, it wil
deliver a level 3 spell (Q = 24). Magical guns cannot score conventional 
critical hits.

ATTACKs with magical guns are not subject to the modifiers found in this 
section; instead, they are subject to those for MOD 5 attacks, where MA0 = WP.
Like those with physical guns, magical gun ATTACKs ignore evasion. They are
subject to Counter Magic, Counter Flood, Blade Grasp, and Hamedo, but do not
trigger other Countergrasp reactions.


CRITICAL HITS
-------------

NOTE: This does not apply to magical guns.

Approximately 5% of the time, the ATTACK command will deliver
a critical hit. The sound of the hit will be more sharp and 
sudden, and the damage numbers will be animated slightly
differently.

Critical hits randomly modify the ATTACKing unit's PA, MA, 
and/or Speed (depending on what weapon the unit is equipped
with) to increase damage. This modified PA, MA, or Speed is 
then plugged into the appropriate formula above to calculate 
the final damage.

Critical hit bonus:

modified_XA = normal_XA + (1..normal_XA) - 1

This equation is equivalent to

modified_XA = normal_XA + (0..(normal_XA-1))

but I suspect that it is the first equation that FFT actually uses,
given that in other cases it generates random numbers of the form
(1..x) rather than (0..x).  However, I don't know for sure.

Regardless, the max damage a critical hit can do is equal to
((2 * normal_XA) - 1) * WP -- slightly less than twice normal
damage -- and the least it can do is normal damage.  Most often it 
will be between these two extrema.

Critical hits will also knock the target back one square
fifty percent of the time (assuming that there is an unoccupied
square directly behind the target).


DAMAGE MODIFIERS
----------------

NOTE: These modifiers do not apply to magical guns. For magical gun
modifiers, see the MOD 5 subsection in section 3.2.

Many factors -- including the attacker's abilities and status, the
target's abilities and status, as well as Zodiac compatibility -- can
affect the damage done by weapon attacks. The procedure outlined below
is a summary of how to apply all these different modifiers.

'XA' below stands for whatever expression that the weapon multiplies by
Weapon Power to get the final damage.  For example, XA = PA for swords,
XA = [(PA + Sp) / 2] for longbows, and XA = WP for physical guns.

If there are multiple instances of the _same_ statistic in a damage
equation (for instance, the non-magic gun and barehand equations), only
modify _one_ instance of the statistic.  See section 1.7 for a 
clarification on this.

Let 'XA0' be the attacker's XA on the stat screen.

   1. If this is a critical hit, then XA1 = XA0 + (1..XA0) - 1
      else XA1 = XA0
      (See section 2.1 for details)
   2. If the weapon is endowed with an element, and the attacker has
      equipment that 'Strengthens' that element, then (XA2 = [XA1 * 5/4]),
      else XA2 = XA1
   3. If attacker has Attack UP, then (XA3 = [XA2 * 4/3]), else XA3 = XA2
   4. If attacker has Martial Arts and is barehanded, then 
      (XA4 = [XA3 * 3/2]), else XA4 = XA3
   5. If attacker is Berserk, then (XA5 = [XA4 * 3/2]), else XA5 = XA4
   6. If target has Defense UP, then (XA6 = [XA5 * 2/3]), else XA6 = XA5
   7. If target has Protect, then (XA7 = [XA6 * 2/3]), else XA7 = XA6
   8. If target is Charging, then (XA8 = [XA7 * 3/2]), else XA8 = XA7
   9. If target is Sleeping, then (XA9 = [XA8 * 3/2]), else XA9 = XA8
  10. If target is a Chicken and/or a Frog, then (XA10 = [XA9 * 3/2]), 
      else XA10 = XA9
  11. Apply zodiac multipliers:
          If compatibility is 'Good', then (XA11 = XA10 + [(XA10)/4]))
          elseIf compatibility is 'Bad', then (XA11 = XA10 - [(XA10)/4])
          elseIf compatibility is 'Best', then (XA11 = XA10 + [(XA10)/2])
          elseIf compatibility is 'Worst', then (XA11 = XA10 - [(XA10)/2])
          else XA11 = XA10
  12. Apply weapon's damage formula using XA = XA11 (if there is more
      than one instance of XA, only set _one_ instance to XA11 and
      leave the other as XA0 (see above). The result of the formula
      is equal to damage0.
  13. If target is 'Weak' against the weapon's element, then
        damage1 = damage0 * 2
      Else, damage1 = damage0
  14. If target has 'Half' against the weapon's element, then
        damage2 = [damage1 / 2]
      Else, damage2 = damage1
  15. If target has 'Absorb' against the weapon's element, then
        damage3 = -(damage2)
      Else, damage3 = damage2
  16. The damage done by the attack will be equal to damage3.

Also remember that weapon attacks can be evaded.  See section 1.3 for
details.

[2.2] charge
      ========================================================================

Damage from the Archer's CHARGE command is calculated using the
normal weapon equations, with the following modifications.

For Charge +K, damage is equal to:

Bare Hands: [((PA + K) * Br) / 100] * PA
Knife: [((PA + K) + (Sp + K)) / 2] * WP
Sword: (PA + K) * WP
Knight Sword: [((PA + K) * Br) / 100] * WP
Ninja Sword: [((PA + K) + (Sp + K)) / 2] * WP
Katana: [((PA + K) * Br) / 100] * WP
Staff: (MA + K) * WP
Rod: (PA + K) * WP
Crossbow: (PA + K) * WP
Bow: [((PA + K) + (Sp + K)) / 2] * WP  
Gun (physical): (WP + K) * WP
Gun (magical): [CFa/100 * TFa/100 * (WP + K) * Q]
Flail: (1..(PA + K)) * WP
Axe: (1..(PA + K)) * WP
Stick: (MA + K) * WP  
Spear: (PA + K) * WP  
Musical Instrument: [(PA+K + MA+K) / 2] * WP 
Dictionary: [(PA+K + MA+K) / 2] * WP 
Cloth: [(PA+K + MA+K) / 2] * WP
Bag: (1..(PA + K)) * WP

CHARGE abilities are slow actions and have the following 
initial values of ctr:

ATTACK NAME    INITIAL CTR
-----------   -------------
Charge +1 ...  4 clockticks 
Charge +2 ...  5 clockticks
Charge +3 ...  6 clockticks
Charge +4 ...  8 clockticks
Charge +5 ... 10 clockticks
Charge +7 ... 14 clockticks
Charge +10... 20 clockticks
Charge +20... 35 clockticks

These ctr values are not affected by the 'Short Charge' or 'Non-charge' 
abilities.

A CHARGE directive can only target a panel, not a unit.  If the target of 
the CHARGE moves before the CHARGE is executed, the attack will fail to 
connect.

If the caster of the CHARGE moves while charging or if his weapon is broken
while he is charging, the CHARGE will be aborted. (Exception: The undead
Archer's version of CHARGE does not have the latter restriction. If the
charging unit's weapon is broken, the CHARGE will continue and will resolve
as a fist attack, even if the original weapon was a long-distance weapon.)

In terms of damage, evasion, and modifiers, CHARGE attacks are treated
just like normal weapon attacks (see section 2.1 for details). CHARGE attacks
are weapon-elemental.


_______________________________________________________________________________
[2.3] jump
      =========================================================================

Damage from a JUMP is calculated as follows:

   If caster is equipped with any weapon, then

                            damage = [PA * K] * WP         
   
   If caster is barehanded, then
                  
                       damage = [(PA * Br) / 100] * PA    

   where K = 3/2 if the caster is equipped with a spear
         K = 1 otherwise

The JUMP directive will leave the caster in the air for a number
of clockticks, ctr:

                        ctr = [50 / (Jumper's Speed)] 

This ctr value is unaffected by the 'Short Charge' and 'Non-Charge'
abilities.  Haste status is ignored in this equation -- a Hasted
jumper will land in the same number of clockticks as an un-Hasted 
jumper with the same Speed. 

While JUMP is charging, the jumper cannot be a target. A jumper's 
CT will still increase while he is in the air, although the counters 
on time-dependent status effects will pause. Normal jumpers will land 
with ~50 CT; Hasted jumpers will land with ~75 CT.

The range of JUMP is determined by the specific Lancer abilities
that the caster has learned:

range/effect = XvY/1

where X = 1 if no Level Jump abilities have been learned
      X = 2 if Level Jump2 is the highest Level Jump ability learned
      X = 3 if Level Jump3 is the highest Level Jump ability learned
      X = 4 if Level Jump4 is the highest Level Jump ability learned
      X = 5 if Level Jump5 is the highest Level Jump ability learned
      .
      .
      .
      X = 8 if Level Jump8 is the highest Level Jump ability learned

and   Y = 1 if no Vertical Jump abilities have been learned
      Y = 2 if Vertical Jump2 is the highest Vertical Jump ability learned
      Y = 3 if Vertical Jump3 is the highest Vertical Jump ability learned
      .
      .
      .
      Y = 8 if Vertical Jump8 is the highest Vertical Jump ability learned

The JP cost of these abilities is as follows:

      Level Jump2 ... 150 JP          Vertical Jump2 ... 100 JP
      Level Jump3 ... 300 JP          Vertical Jump3 ... 200 JP
      Level Jump4 ... 450 JP          Vertical Jump4 ... 300 JP
      Level Jump5 ... 600 JP          Vertical Jump5 ... 400 JP
      Level Jump8 ... 900 JP          Vertical Jump6 ... 500 JP
                                      Vertical Jump7 ... 600 JP
                                      Vertical Jump8 ... 900 JP

MODIFIERS
- - - - -

JUMP damage is subject to several modifiers.  Let PA0 be the jumper's PA as 
displayed on the status screen.

 1. If target has Defense UP, then (PA1 = [PA0 * 2/3]), else PA1 = PA0
 2. If target has Protect, then (PA2 = [PA1 * 2/3]), else PA2 = PA1
 3. If target is Charging, then (PA3 = [PA2 * 3/2]), else PA3 = PA2
 4. If target is Sleeping, then (PA4 = [PA3 * 3/2]), else PA4 = PA3
 5. If target is a Frog and/or Chicken, then (PA5 = [PA4 * 3/2]), else 
    PA5 = PA4
 6. If caster is equipped with a spear, then (PA6 = [PA5 * 3/2]), else
    PA6 = PA5
 7. Factor in zodiac compatibility:
          If compatibility is 'Good', then (PA7 = PA6 + [(PA6)/4]))
          ElseIf compatibility is 'Bad', then (PA7 = PA6 - [(PA6)/4])
          ElseIf compatibility is 'Best', then (PA7 = PA6 + [(PA6)/2])
          ElseIf compatibility is 'Worst', then (PA7 = PA6 - [(PA6)/2])
          Else PA7 = PA6
 7. Damage = PA7 * WP (armed) or damage = PA7 * [PA0 * Br/100] (unarmed)

Miscellaneous properties of JUMP:

> Physical attack
> non-elemental, regardless of weapon
> Cannot be Reflected
> Cannot be evaded
> Triggers Countergrasp reactions
> Triggers Counter Flood
> Does not trigger Counter Magic 
> Affected by Protect and Defense UP
> NOT affected by Attack UP or Martial Arts
> Can only target panels, not specific units
> The (PA * WP) component of the damage formula remains the same regardless 
  of the weapon equipped -- even if that weapon does not use this formula 
  to calculate its ATTACK damage (e.g. staves, dictionaries, knives, guns).
> Jump +X and Ignore Height have NO effect on the JUMP command -- these 
  abilities influence the Jump statistic, which is completely different
  from the JUMP action ability.

[2.4] throw
      =========================================================================

THROW damage is calculated by the following equation.

                    damage = (Caster_Speed * ThrownWeaponPower)

'ThrownWeaponPower' is the WP of the thrown weapon (see Appendix B for a list 
of Weapon Powers).

The range and effect of THROW are M/1 (line of sight), where M is equal to 
your 'Move' statistic.

In order to THROW a weapon, you must learn the Ninja ability corresponding 
to that weapon's type.  These abilities are as follows:

   Shuriken .........  50 JP; allows the unit to THROW shuriken
   Ball .............  70 JP; allows the unit to THROW bombs
   Knife ............ 100 JP; allows the unit to THROW daggers
   Sword ............ 100 JP; allows the unit to THROW regular swords
   Hammer ........... 100 JP; allows the unit to THROW flails
   Katana ........... 100 JP; allows the unit to THROW katana
   Ninja Sword ...... 100 JP; allows the unit to THROW ninja swords
   Axe .............. 120 JP; allows the unit to THROW axes
   Spear ............ 100 JP; allows the unit to THROW spears
   Stick ............ 100 JP; allows the unit to THROW sticks
   Knight Sword ..... 100 JP; allows the unit to THROW knight swords
   Dictionary ....... 100 JP; allows the unit to THROW dictionaries

MODIFIERS
- - - - -

THROW is a physical attack, but oddly enough it is not affected by Attack UP.
Below is a summary of the different multipliers that may be applied to it.

The 'thrower' is the unit throwing the weapon, and the 'target' is the unit 
being attacked. Let 'Sp0' be the thrower's initial Speed, given on the 
status screen. 
 
  1. If target has Defense UP, then (Sp1 = [Sp0 * 2/3]), else Sp1 = Sp0
  2. If target has Protect, then (Sp2 = [Sp1 * 2/3]), else Sp2 = Sp1
  3. If target is Charging, then (Sp3 = [Sp2 * 3/2]), else Sp3 = Sp2
  4. If target is Sleeping, then (Sp4 = [Sp3 * 3/2]), else Sp4 = Sp3
  5. If target is a Frog and/or Chicken, then (Sp5 = [Sp4 * 3/2]), else 
     Sp5 = Sp4
  6. Apply zodiac multipliers:
           If compatibility is 'Good', then (Sp6 = Sp5 + [(Sp5)/4]))
           ElseIf compatibility is 'Bad', then (Sp6 = Sp5 - [(Sp5)/4])
           ElseIf compatibility is 'Best', then (Sp6 = Sp5 + [(Sp5)/2])
           ElseIf compatibility is 'Worst', then (Sp6 = Sp5 - [(Sp5)/2])
           Else Sp6 = Sp5
  7. damage0 = Sp6 * (ThrownWpnPwr)
  8. If target is 'Weak' against the weapon's element, then
         damage1 = damage0 * 2
       Else, damage1 = damage0
  9. If target has 'Half' against the weapon's element, then
         damage2 = [damage1 / 2]
       Else, damage2 = damage1
 10. If target has 'Absorb' against the weapon's element, then
         damage3 = -(damage2)
       Else, damage3 = damage2
 11. The damage done by the THROW attack will be equal to damage3.

Evasion for THROW attacks works the same as it does for normal weapon
attacks (see 1.4).

Miscellaneous properties of THROW:

> Physical attack
> Acquires the elemental of the thrown weapon. THROW damage is not affected
  if the caster has an elemental 'Strengthen' attribute, but is affected if
  the target halves, blocks, absorbs, or is weak to the elemental of the
  thrown weapon.
> Cannot be Reflected
> Can be evaded
> Triggers Countergrasp reactions
> Triggers Counter Flood
> Triggers Catch: If Catch succeeds, the THROW directive is aborted,
  a 'Caught' message is displayed, and the thrown weapon is added to
  the catcher's inventory.
> Does not trigger Counter Magic
> Affected by Protect and Defense UP
> NOT affected by Attack UP

[2.5] item 
      =========================================================================

The Chemist's ITEM command allows a unit to use various curative items
in battle.  In order to use an ITEM ability, you must have at least one
of the appropriate item in your inventory; each time you use an ITEM
command, your stock of that item will be depleted by 1.

The range and effect of ITEM are 4/1 (line of sight) if the item-user has 
the 'Throw Item' support ability (this includes all Chemists, which have 
'Throw Item' inherently), and 1/1 otherwise.

Here is a list of all usable items, their effects, their costs in gil, and 
the JP cost to learn the Chemist ability that allows you to use them in 
battle.

[2.7] math skill
      =========================================================================

The MATH SKILL command allows you to cast WHITE MAGIC, BLACK MAGIC, TIME MAGIC,
and YIN-YANG MAGIC spells on many targets, instantly and without MP cost. When
you choose MATH SKILL, you will be presented with three menus that you will 
use to set the parameters that govern the MATH SKILL attack.

First menu:  Here you set the criterion that will determine who the spell
             targets.  The more Calculator JP you spend, the more options
             will appear here:

             CT           250 JP    Target based on units' CT
             Level        350 JP    Target based on units' Level
             Height       200 JP    Target based on units' height
             Exp          200 JP    Target based on units' Exp

Second menu: Here you define the numerical properties of the MATH SKILL.

             Prime Number 300 JP    Targets prime integers
             5            200 JP    Targets integer multiples of 5
             4            400 JP    Targets integer multiples of 4
             3            600 JP    Targets integer multiples of 3

             By 'integer multiple of n', I mean any integer Z such that

             n * j = Z

             for some integer j, j > 0.

Third menu:  Here you select the spell you want to use.  These are all marked
             as "CALC: +" in section 3.3, and are listed below.

             Cure       Wall       Ice        Stop            Zombie
             Cure 2     Esuna      Ice 2      Don't Move      Silence Song
             Cure 3     Holy       Ice 3      Float           Blind Rage
             Raise      Fire       Poison     Reflect         Foxbird
             Raise 2    Fire 2     Frog       Demi            Confusion Song
             Reraise    Fire 3     Death      Demi 2          Dispel Magic
             Regen      Bolt       Flare      Blind           Paralyze
             Protect    Bolt 2     Haste      Pray Faith      Sleep
             Shell      Bolt 3     Slow       Doubt Faith     Petrify

The MATH SKILL will then be cast, using the parameters you selected from the
first, second and third menus.  The spell will not cost any MP, and will be
executed instantly.  Damage formulas, success rates, and evade percentages
work exactly as if the spell had been cast by normal means.


_______________________________________________________________________________
[2.8] mimic                  
      =========================================================================

A Mime will automatically mimic slow-actions and fast-actions (but not
reactions) executed by any member of his or her team. There are some catches
to this:

- Only mimeable actions will be mimicked. Mimeable actions are all those
  accessible to generics -- action abilities from the following command sets:
  
  ATTACK          PUNCH ART        STEAL            DRAW OUT
  BASIC SKILL     WHITE MAGIC      TALK SKILL       THROW
  ITEM            BLACK MAGIC      YIN-YANG MAGIC   MATH SKILL
  BATTLE SKILL    TIME MAGIC       ELEMENTAL        SING
  CHARGE          SUMMON MAGIC     JUMP             DANCE

- Mimes won't mimic the actions of other Mimes.

- A Mime can't mimic while afflicted by Dead, Petrify, Sleep, Stop,
  Blood Suck, Don't Act, Frog, Chicken, Confusion, or Berserk. If the
  Mime is Silence, he or she won't be able to mimic attacks that are
  prevented by Silence.
  
The mimicked attack will have the same effect area as the original attack,
and be directed to the panel that is in the same position relative to the 
Mime as the panel targeted by the original attack was to the original caster.
However, casters will always turn to face their target before executing an
attack, and it is THIS position (after turning) that the Mime will mimic.
Because the target is always in front of the caster after turning, it 
follows that the Mime can only target panels in front of him or her.
Here's a digram:

 _______________________________________ 
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |xxx|xxx|xxx|   C = original caster
|   |   |   | 1 |   |   | 2'|xxx|xxx|xxx|   M = Mime
|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|xxx|xxx|xxx|   ^ = direction caster is facing
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |xxx|xxx|       before acting
|   |   |   |   |   |   | 1'|   |xxx|xxx|   < = direction Mime is facing
|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|xxx|xxx|   
|   |   | ^ |   |   |   |   |   |   |xxx|   1, 2, 3 = panels targeted by
|   |   | C |   |   |   | 3'|   |<M |xxx|   caster of spells 1, 2, and 3 
|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|xxx|   
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |xxx|xxx|   1', 2', 3' = panels targeted
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |xxx|xxx|   by Mime when mimicking 1, 2,
|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|xxx|xxx|   and 3, respectively
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |xxx|xxx|xxx|
|   |   | 3 |   | 2 |   |   |xxx|xxx|xxx|   x's indicate panels the Mime
|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|xxx|xxx|xxx|   cannot reach with mimicry


Here C is facing up before casting, and M is facing to the left.

The panel targeted by (1) is considered to be in FRONT of C (using the
same guidelines outlined for physical evasion in section 1.4), so 
when C casts (1), he doesn't turn. (1) is targeted 2 panels ahead and 1
panel to the right of C. When M mimics it, she places it 2 panels ahead
and 1 panel to the right of her, on the panel labeled (1').

The panel targeted by (2) is considered to be to the SIDE of C [2 panels
to the right and 2 panels backward -- it's a 'tie', so the foremost
direction (SIDE) wins]. C will turn to the RIGHT before casting (2),
making the panel (2) 2 panels ahead and 2 panels to the right of the
now-turned C. When M mimics, she aims 2 panels ahead and 2 panels to the 
right of her, on the panel labeled (2').

Finally, the panel targeted by (3) is to the REAR of C, so C will turn
to face DOWN before casting (3). After turning, panel (3) will be 2
panels directly ahead of C. So when M mimics, she aims 2 panels directly
ahead of her, at the panel labeled (3').

To borrow an analogy from Notti, a Mime could be considered to radiate
a cone of light in front of her like a spotlight. Only panels within
this cone can be targeted. The (inclusive) peripheral limits of this 
cone are the squares along the front-left and front-right 45-degree
diagonals radiating out from the Mime.

A few more notes about Mimes:
- Mimed spells use no MP and are always executed instantly. 
- Mimed ITEM, THROW, and DRAW OUT directives consume no items (mimed 
  THROWs cannot be Caught). 
- Damage and success rate will be calculated based on the Mime's stats 
  and abilities. The exceptions to this are attacks that use weapons, 
  such as ATTACK, CHARGE, and JUMP. For these attacks, the weapon
  used by the original caster will automatically materialize in the 
  Mime's hands, and its value of WP and its damage formula will be used. 
- Support abilities like Two Swords and Two Hands are NOT copied by the 
  Mime. If, for instance, the Mime mimics a Two Sworded ATTACK where 
  the original caster is equipped with Masamune (top hand) and
  Chirijiraden (bottom hand), the Mime will only attack with Masamune.
- Charmed or Invited Mimes will mimic the team that Charmed or Invited
  them (Charmed Mimes will revert to their original team when Charm
  wears off). 
- If there is more than one Mime on a given team, each attack executed
  by that team will be mimicked individually by each Mime.
- Mimed actions trigger reaction abilities just like normal actions;
  reactions are executed immediately after the mimed action, even
  if there are more mimes yet to mimic the original action. Reactions
  are the only thing that can interrupt the mime cycle (see A.3).

For more details on the impact of Mimes on gameflow, see sections A.3 and
A.4 of the gameflow appendix.

[3.1] legend
      =========================================================================

What follows is a chart containing detailed information on the 356 action
abilities in FFT that were not covered in Part 2. In this section is a key 
to the abbreviations that appear in the chart.

[ xxx ] .....  The number between brackets at the top-center of each box is the
               index number for this attack, in hexadecimal.  Attacks with an
               index number less than or equal to 095 can be Mimicked; those
               with an index number of 096 or greater cannot.

The words in ALL CAPS in the upper-right-hand corner are the command set
from which the attack originates.  Some attacks are found in more than one
command set; for these, only one set is listed.

Abbreviations used in the list are defined below:

physical .... This attack meets at least one of the three following criteria:
              (a) Damage or success rate is increased by the caster's
                  having 'Attack UP'
              (b) Damage or success rate is decreased by the target's
                  having 'Defense UP' or 'Protect' status
              (c) Success rate is decreased by the target's physical evade.
              If a physical attack does not meet one or two of these criteria, 
              it will be noted in the attack description (or as EVD: -).

magical ..... This attack meets at least one of the three following criteria:
              (a) Damage or success rate is increased by the caster's
                  having 'Magic AttackUP'
              (b) Damage or success rate is decreased by the target's
                  having 'Magic DefendUP' or 'Shell' status.
              (c) Success rate is decreased by the target's magical evade.
              Most magical attacks meet more than one of these criteria; 
              if an attack does not meet one of them, it will be noted in 
              the attack description (or as EVD: -). (In general, magical 
              attacks that have beneficial effects, such as Cure and Protect,
              are not susceptible to 'Shell', 'Magic DefendUP', or magic 
              evade.)

neutral ..... This attack is neither physical nor magical.

REFL ........ + This attack is redirected if target has 'Reflect' status.
              - This attack is unaffected by 'Reflect'.

CALC ........ + This attack can be used with MATH SKILL.
              - This attack cannot be used with MATH SKILL.

ELEM ........ Indicates the attack's elemental affiliation. See section 1.6 
              for more information.
              F = Fire       A = Wind (Air)  H = Holy
              I = Ice        W = Water       D = Dark
              L = Lightning  E = Earth     wpn = Weapon-elemental
              Weapon-elemental (wpn) attacks use the elemental property
              of whatever weapon the caster is equipped with (if the caster
              has two weapons, the weapon equipped in the top hand takes 
              precedence). In addition, weapon-elemental attacks are not 
              subject to any bonus from 'Martial Arts'.              
              
MOD ......... Indicates the type of damage or success rate modifiers that
              apply to this attack. See section 3.2 for details.

CBG ......... + This attack activates Countergrasp reactions (see 4.1)
              - This attack does not activate Countergrasp reactions

CM .......... + This attack activates 'Counter Magic' (see 4.1)
              - This attack does not activate 'Counter Magic'

CF .......... + This attack activates 'Counter Flood' (see 4.1)
              - This attack does not activate 'Counter Flood'

EVD ......... + This attack is subject to evade (physical if it is a physical
                attack, magical if it is a magical attack)
              - This attack is not subject to evade

MP .......... Amount of Magic Points required to use this attack

CTR ......... Number of clockticks that must elapse before the attack resolves.
              If CTR = 0, the attack is a fast action. If CTR > 0, the caster 
              will be inflicted with 'Charging' status until the attack 
              resolves or until the caster cancels 'Charging' by selecting 
              another command during another AT.  Exception: if the attack is
              a SING or DANCE attack, 'Performing' will be inflicted on the 
              caster instead of 'Charging'. 'Performing' will not be cancelled
              unless the caster chooses another command from the AT menu on a
              subsequent AT; barring this, the SING or DANCE attack will 
              continue to be executed every Nth clocktick, where N = CTR.

JP .......... Job Points required to purchase this ability

MATHEMATICAL SYMBOLS
--------------------

[x / y]      Divide x by y and take only the integer part of the quotient,
             discarding the remainder.  For example, [12 / 4] = 3,
             [13 / 4] = 3, [-14 / 4] = -3, [15 / 4] = 3, [16 / 4] = 4.

RU{x / y}    This is defined as [(x + y - 1) / y].  Intuitively, you can
             think of it as dividing and, if there is a nonzero remainder,
             rounding up to the nearest integer.

(x..y)       The game generates a random integer between x and y,
             inclusive.

OTHER ABBREVIATIONS
-------------------

Critical hit 
possible .......... This attack has the potential to cause a critical hit.
                    Critical hits will occur ~5% of the time. To calculate
                    critical hit damage, see the procedure in section 3.2
                    under "MOD: 2".

Drain ............. Damage from this attack is subtracted from the target's
                    current HP or MP and then added to the caster's current
                    HP or MP.

Undead reversal ... If the target of this attack is Undead, then any damage
                    done to that target will instead heal the target by an
                    amount equal to the putative damage. In addition, if
                    the target of this attack is Undead, any healing done
                    to that target will instead damage the target; the
                    damage will be equal in magnitude to the putative
                    healing.

C_x ............... "Caster's x" -- for example, "C_MaxHP" means caster's 
                    maximum HP.

T_x ............... "Target's x" -- for example, "T_MaxHP" means target's 
                    maximum HP.

LOS ............... Target must lie along caster's line of sight in order
                    for this attack to hit; if another unit intervenes on
                    this line between caster and target, the other unit
                    will suffer the effect of the spell instead of the
                    target.

CI ................ Caster immune. If placed after the Range number, this
                    means that the caster cannot target himself with this
                    attack. If placed after the Effect number, this means
                    that if even if the caster is within the effect area
                    of this attack, the attack will not hit him. If an
                    attack is CI in Range, it will always be CI in Effect,
                    but this will not be explicitly listed.

4 directions ...... Range extends linearly in four directions: in front of
                    caster, behind caster, and to both sides of caster.

3 directions ...... Effect area extends linearly in three directions: in
                    front of caster and to both sides of caster.

MaxHP ............. Maximum HP
CurrentHP ......... HP currently remaining
MaxMP ............. Maximum MP
CurrentMP ......... MP currently remaining
Sp ................ Speed
PA ................ Physical attack power
MA ................ Magical attack power
Br ................ Brave
CFa ............... Caster's Faith
TFa ............... Target's Faith

[3.2] damage and success rate modifiers
      =========================================================================

The attacks of FFT fall into several categories of damage & success modifiers.
In the list below, they will be classified into 7 different types.

To quickly jump back to these descriptions, Search for "[MOD n]" (without the
quotes), where n is the MOD value for the attack you're interested in.


[MOD 0] ~ immutable
-------------------
The damage or success rate of these attacks is subject to no modifications --
it is not even affected by Zodiac compatibility.


[MOD 1] ~ neutral attacks : success rate variable
-------------------------------------------------

The success rate of these attacks is affected only by Zodiac compatibility --
nothing else. Let K be the constant component of the success formula. For 
example, for the TALK SKILL Death Sentence, K = 30.

   1. Calculate Z (zodiac addend):
        If compatibility is 'Good', then Z = [MA / 4] + [K / 4]
        ElseIf compatibility is 'Bad', then Z = -[MA / 4] - [K / 4]
        ElseIf compatibility is 'Best', then Z = [MA / 2] + [K / 2]
        ElseIf compatibility is 'Worst', then Z = -[MA / 2] - [K / 2]
        Else, Z = 0
   2. Apply success rate formula: success% = (MA + K + Z)
   

[MOD 2] ~ physical attacks : damage variable
--------------------------------------------

XA below stands for the relevant attack stat for the attack in question.

If there are multiple instances of the _same_ statistic in a damage
equation, only modify _one_ instance of the statistic.  See section 1.7 
for a clarification on this.

Let XA0 be the caster's XA on the stat screen. 

   1. If this is a critical hit, then XA1 = XA0 + (1..XA0) - 1.  
   2. If the attack is endowed with an Element, and the caster has
      equipment that 'Strengthens' that element, then (XA2 = [XA1 * 5/4]),
      else XA2 = XA1
   3. If caster has Attack UP, then (XA3 = [XA2 * 4/3]), else XA3 = XA2
   4. If caster has Martial Arts AND this is not a wpn-elemental attack,
      then (XA4 = [XA3 * 3/2]), else XA4 = XA3
   5. If caster is Berserk, then (XA5 = [XA4 * 3/2]), else XA5 = XA4
   6. If target has Defense UP, then (XA6 = [XA5 * 2/3]), else XA6 = XA5
   7. If target has Protect, then (XA7 = [XA6 * 2/3]), else XA7 = XA6
   8. If target is Charging, then (XA8 = [XA7 * 3/2]), else XA8 = XA7
   9. If target is Sleeping, then (XA9 = [XA8 * 3/2]), else XA9 = XA8
  10. If target is a Chicken and/or a Frog, then (XA10 = [XA9 * 3/2]), 
      else XA10 = XA9
  11. Apply zodiac multipliers:
          If compatibility is 'Good', then (XA11 = XA10 + [(XA10)/4]))
          ElseIf compatibility is 'Bad', then (XA11 = XA10 - [(XA10)/4])
          ElseIf compatibility is 'Best', then (XA11 = XA10 + [(XA10)/2])
          ElseIf compatibility is 'Worst', then (XA11 = XA10 - [(XA10)/2])
          Else, XA11 = XA10
  12. Apply the attack's damage formula with XA = XA11. Call the calculated
      damage damage0.
  13. If target is 'Weak' against the attack's element, then
        damage1 = damage0 * 2
      Else, damage1 = damage0
  14. If target has 'Half' against the attack's element, then
        damage2 = [damage1 / 2]
      Else, damage2 = damage1
  15. If target has 'Absorb' against the attack's element, then
        damage3 = -(damage2)
      Else, damage3 = damage2
  16. The damage done by the attack will be equal to damage3.


[MOD 3] ~ physical attacks : success rate variable
--------------------------------------------------

The value of K is equal to the constant component of the attack's
formula -- for example, if the attack's base success rate is equal
to (PA + 50), then K = 50.

NOTE: For the equipment-breaking BATTLE SKILL attacks, both PA and
WP are treated as independent XA's, and are both modified by zodiac
compatibility along with K (step 8), though only PA is modified by
steps 1 - 7.

 1. If caster has Attack UP, then (XA1 = [XA0 * 4/3]), else XA1 = XA0
 2. If caster has Martial Arts and is bare-handed, then 
    (XA2 = [XA1 * 3/2]), else XA2 = XA1
 3. If target has Defense UP, then (XA3 = [XA2 * 2/3]), else XA3 = XA2
 4. If target has Protect, then (XA4 = [XA3 * 2/3]), else XA4 = XA3
 5. If target is Charging, then (XA5 = [XA4 * 3/2]), else XA5 = XA4
 6. If target is Sleeping, then (XA6 = [XA5 * 3/2]), else XA6 = XA5
 7. If target is a Frog and/or Chicken, then (XA7 = [XA6 * 3/2]), else 
    XA7 = XA6
 8. Calculate Z (zodiac addend):
    For Head Break, Armor Break, Shield Break, Weapon Break:
      If compatibility is 'Good', then Z = [XA7 / 4] + [K / 4] + [WP / 4] 
      ElseIf compatibility is 'Bad', then Z = -[XA7 / 4] - [K / 4] - [WP / 4]
      ElseIf compatibility is 'Best', then Z = [XA7 / 2] + [K / 2] + [WP / 2]
      ElseIf compatibility is 'Worst', then Z = -[XA7 / 2] - [K / 2] - [WP / 2]
      Else, Z = 0
    For all other MOD 3 attacks:
      If compatibility is 'Good', then Z = [XA7 / 4] + [K / 4] 
      ElseIf compatibility is 'Bad', then Z = -[XA7 / 4] - [K / 4]
      ElseIf compatibility is 'Best', then Z = [XA7 / 2] + [K / 2]
      ElseIf compatibility is 'Worst', then Z = -[XA7 / 2] - [K / 2]
      Else, Z = 0
    XA8 = XA7 + Z
 9. Apply success rate formula using XA = XA8.
10. Consider physical evasion multipliers, if applicable.
Note that elementals have no effect on MOD 3 attacks, unless they also
cause damage, in which case the damage is affected (in practice, there 
are no MOD 3 attacks that both cause damage and have elemental 
affiliation, though).


[MOD 4] ~ steal
---------------

Attacks of this type are all STEAL directives.  The 'caster' is the unit 
executing the STEAL directive, and the 'target' is the unit being stolen 
from.  Let Sp0 be the caster's original Speed as given on the status 
screen. K is equal to the constant component of the STEAL formula --
for instance, K = 30 for Steal Weapon.

   1. If caster has Attack UP, then (Sp1 = [Sp0 * 4/3]), else Sp1 = Sp0
   2. If caster has Martial Arts, then (Sp2 = [Sp1 * 3/2]), else Sp2 = Sp1
   3. If target has Defense UP, then (Sp3 = [Sp2 * 2/3]), else Sp3 = Sp2
   4. If target has Protect, then (Sp4 = [Sp3 * 2/3]), else Sp4 = Sp3
   5. If target is Charging, then (Sp5 = [Sp4 * 3/2]), else Sp5 = Sp4
   6. If target is Sleeping, then (Sp6 = [Sp5 * 3/2]), else Sp6 = Sp5
   7. If target is a Frog and/or Chicken, then (Sp7 = [Sp6 * 3/2]), else 
      Sp7 = Sp6
   8. Calculate Z (zodiac addend):
        If compatibility is 'Good', then Z = [Sp7 / 4] + [K / 4]  
        ElseIf compatibility is 'Bad', then Z = -[Sp7 / 4] - [K / 4]
        ElseIf compatibility is 'Best', then Z = [Sp7 / 2] + [K / 2]
        ElseIf compatibility is 'Worst', then Z = -[Sp7 / 2] - [K / 2]
        Else, Z = 0
   9. Success% = (Sp7 + K + Z)
  10. Consider physical evasion multipliers, if applicable.


[MOD 5] ~ magical attacks : damage variable
-------------------------------------------

Let MA0 be the caster's MA on the status screen. 

  1. If caster has 'Strengthen: [element of spell]', then (MA1 = [MA0 * 5/4])
     else MA1 = MA0
  2. If caster has Magic AttackUP, then (MA2 = [MA1 * 4/3]), else MA2 = MA1 
  3. If target has Magic DefendUP, then (MA3 = [MA2 * 2/3]), else MA3 = MA2
  4. If target has Shell, then (MA4 = [MA3 * 2/3]), else MA5 = MA4
  5. Apply zodiac multipliers:
          If compatibility is 'Good', then (MA5 = MA4 + [(MA4)/4]))
          ElseIf compatibility is 'Bad', then (MA5 = MA4 - [(MA4)/4])
          ElseIf compatibility is 'Best', then (MA5 = MA4 + [(MA4)/2])
          ElseIf compatibility is 'Worst', then (MA5 = MA4 - [(MA4)/2])
          Else, MA5 = MA
  6. Apply Faith modifiers:
          If this is an UN-TRUTH attack:
             If caster or target has Faith status, then CFa = 0 or TFa = 0,
                respectively
             If caster or target has Innocent status, then CFa = 100 or
                TFa = 100, respectively
          Else:
             If caster or target has Faith status, then CFa = 100 or 
                TFa = 100, respectively
             If caster or target has Innocent status, then CFa = 0 or
                TFa = 0, respectively
  ** The next steps deal with elemental damage modification. This takes the
     form of a fraction, Frac = N/D, that is applied to the numerator and
     demoninator of the damage formula. Frac should be kept as a fraction
     throughout these steps, and not truncated. **
  8. a. If this is a snowstorm and the spell is ice-elemental, then
          Frac0 = 5/4, else Frac0 = 1
     b. If this is a thunderstorm and the spell is fire-elemental, then
          Frac1 = Frac0 * 3/4, else Frac1 = Frac0
     c. If this is a thunderstorm and the spell is lightning-elemental, then
          Frac2 = Frac1 * 5/4, else Frac2 = Frac1
     Else, Frac2 = 1
  9. If target is 'Weak' against spell's element, then
       Frac3 = Frac2 * 2
     Else, Frac3 = Frac2
 10. If target has 'Half' spell's element, then
       Frac4 = Frac3 * 1/2
     Else, Frac4 = Frac3
 11. If target has 'Absorb' spell's element, then
       Frac5 = -(Frac4)
     Else, Frac5 = Frac4
 12. Frac5 should be a fraction with a numerator and denominator. Call
     the numerator N and the denominator D. Q is the constant found in the
     spell's damage formula. For UN-TRUTH attacks (see section 3.12 for a
     more detailed discussion and explanation of the formula), the damage 
     will be equal to

     damage = [(CFM * TFM * [(MA0 + Q) / 2] * MA5 * N) / (10000 * D)]
     
     For all other MOD 5 attacks, damage is determined as
     
     damage = [(CFa * TFa * Q * MA5 * N) / (10000 * D)]
       

[MOD 6] ~ magical attacks : success rate variable
-------------------------------------------------

Let MA0 be the caster's MA as listed on the status screen, and Y be the
constant component of the spell's success rate formula. For instance, for
Death, Y = 100.

  1. If caster has 'Strengthen: [element of spell]', then (MA1 = [MA0 * 5/4])
     else MA1 = MA0                                           
  2. If caster has Magic AttackUP, then (MA2 = [MA1 * 4/3]), else MA2 = MA1
  3. If target has Magic DefendUP, then (MA3 = [MA2 * 2/3]), else MA3 = MA2
  4. If target has Shell, then (MA4 = [MA3 * 2/3]), else MA4 = MA3
  5. Calculate Z (Zodiac addend):                             
        If compatibility is 'Good', then Z = [MA4 / 4] + [Y / 4]  
        ElseIf compatibility is 'Bad', then Z = -[MA4 / 4] - [Y / 4]
        ElseIf compatibility is 'Best', then Z = [MA4 / 2] + [Y / 2]
        ElseIf compatibility is 'Worst', then Z = -[MA4 / 2] - [Y / 2]
        Else, Z = 0                                           
  6. Apply the spell's success% formula as follows:           
     success% = [(CFa * TFa * (MA4 + Y + Z)) / 10000]         
     If caster or target has Faith status, then CFa = 100 or TFa = 100, 
     respectively.  If caster or target has Innocent status, then CFa = 0 
     or TFa = 0, respectively.                                
  7. Apply any evasion percentages that the target has due to his 
     equipment.                                               
  8. Some MOD 6 attacks do damage based on a percentage of the target's MaxHP.
     If we call the percentage Q (e.g., Q = 50 for an attack that takes off
     half the MaxHP), and calculate a value for Frac5 by using steps 8 - 11
     of the MOD 5 algorithm above, and Frac5 = N/D, then the damage done
     will be equal to
     
     damage = RU{(TargetMaxHP * Q * N) / (100 * D)}


[MOD 6a] ~ golem
----------------

Golem is a special case of MOD 6 where only the caster's stats matter,
and Shell and Magic DefendUP have no effect:
                                     
  1. If caster has Magic AttackUP, then (MA1 = [MA0 * 4/3]), else MA1 = MA0
  2. Apply Golem's success% formula as follows:           
     success% = [(CFa * (MA1 + 200)) / 100]         
     If caster has Faith status, then CFa = 100. If caster has Innocent 
     status, then CFa = 0.                                
  
  
[MOD 7] ~ work attacks 
----------------------

The Steel Giant's WORK attacks are neutral attacks that depend only on 
Zodiac compatibility. Let PA0 be the caster's PA on the stat screen.

   1. Apply zodiac multipliers:
         If compatibility is 'Good', then PA1 = PA0 + [PA0 / 4]
         ElseIf compatibility is 'Bad', then PA1 = PA0 - [PA0 / 4]
         ElseIf compatibility is 'Best', then PA1 = PA0 + [PA0 / 2]
         ElseIf compatibility is 'Worst', then PA1 = PA0 - [PA0 / 2]
         Else, PA1 = PA0
   2. Calculate damage using PA = PA1.

The list is in the following format:

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The attacks are listed in order of index number; this is the bracketed number
in the center of the top line of each box.

To find an attack: use the Find or Search feature (often Ctrl + F), and 
search for "| Attack name" (without the quotes), where "Attack name" is the 
name of the attack you're interested in. Make sure to leave one, and only one, 
space after the "|" character.

To find an index number reference from the chart or from elsewhere in the 
BMG, search for "[ xxx ]" (without the quotes), where xxx is the index number 
(in hex) of the attack. Make sure to leave spaces between the brackets and 
the beginning and end of the index number.

And away we go....

 NOTE: Some formulas below are listed in forms that involve decimals
       because these are the easiest way to work with them on a calculator.
       However, FFT does not appear to use floating point arithmetic, and 
       all division is integer divison. Here are the versions of the formulas
       as they are most likely passed to FFT's calculation system. In the
       decimal-form equations, the brackets [] signify truncation of the 
       decimal. Each pair of formulas is equivalent because truncation is
       based on the divisor 10000 in both cases.

[3.4] magic constants: damage         
      =========================================================================

The next few sections distill some of the more useful pieces of information 
from section 3.3 into a more condensed format. Here is a list of every spell
in the game that uses the common faith-based damage formula:

                     damage = [(MA * CFa * TFa * Q)/10000]
                     
The chart lists each spell's value for Q, the MP cost, and a few other
parameters. It's in alphabetical order for easy eyeballing.

LEGEND
------
Q-VALUE : constant which determines strength of spell.  See [3.1].
MP : amount of MP that must be expended to cast the spell
ELE : elemental attributes of the spell:
      F: fire  L: lightning   H: holy  W: water  U: undead reversal
      I: ice   A: wind (air)  D: dark  E: earth  -: no elemental
CM? : 'x' indicates that the spell can be countered with Counter Magic
REF : 'x' indicates that the spell will be reflected by Reflect status
CAL : 'x' indicates that the spell can be Calculated
R/E : the spell's range and effect
EV? : 'x' indicates the spell's can be avoided with a unit's magic evasion

[3.5] magic constants: effects                                                 
      =========================================================================

Magic that depends on faith and causes a special effect -- such as a status 
abnormality, a reduction in stats, or a reduction in HP by a set percentage --
is governed by this equation:
          
                 base success% = [CFa/100 * TFa/100 * (MA + Y)]

where Y is a constant specific to the spell (ranging from 100 to 250), CFa is 
the caster's Faith, and TFa is the target's Faith.

These spells are subject to all of the MOD 6 modifications listed in 3.2. 
If the spell is subject to evasion (marked with an 'e' in the chart below), 
then the base success percentage will be multiplied by the target's magic 
evasion factor to determine the final success percentage.

Values of Y range from 100 to 250, while MA is usually less than 30, so 
MA is not that crucial to the success of these spells -- Faith is much more 
important. Because of this, effect magic makes a good secondary skill for
a high-Faith unit in a job with low MA. 

The chart below allows quick comparisons of all the game's effect magic.
For more details in each spell, look it up in section 3.3 by searching for
the spell name within [square brackets].


LEGEND
------
Y   : constant used in determining the success rate of the spell
MP  : MP cost of the spell
CTR : charge time of the spell, in clockticks 
CM  : 'c' indicates that the spell can be countered with Counter Magic
RF  : 'r' indicates that the spell will be reflected by Reflect status
CA  : 'a' indicates that the spell can be calculated
EV  : 'e' indicates that the spell can be evaded with magic evade

For any spells of this type that cause damage, the damage is unaffected 
by Protect, Shell, Magic AttackUP and Magic DefendUP, but the success 
rate is affected.

[3.6] battle skill                                                   
      =========================================================================

BATTLE SKILL directives are physical attacks, even if shot from a magical gun. 
For the equipment breaks, the formula is

              success% =  (Caster's PA + WP + K) * (evasion factor)

where K is a command-specific constant:

COMMAND        RESULT                  K      
-------------  ----------------------  -- 
Head Break     Breaks target's helmet  45
Armor Break    Breaks target's armor   40
Shield Break   Breaks target's shield  55
Weapon Break   Breaks target's weapon  30

If the caster is not equipped with a weapon, WP = 0.

For the stat breaks, the formula is,

               success% =  (Caster's PA + K) * (evasion factor)

where K is a command-specific constant:

COMMAND        RESULT                          K 
-------------  ------------------------------- --
Magic Break    MP damage: RU{T_MaxMP * 50/100} 50
Speed Break    Speed -2                        50
Power Break    PA -3                           50
Mind Break     MA -3                           50

If a BATTLE SKILL is targeted on a type of item that the target is not 
equipped with, an ATTACK directive will be executed instead of the 
BATTLE SKILL. The evasion factor is present even if the BATTLE SKILL
is shot out of a gun. BATTLE SKILLs are MOD 3 attacks and are subject
to all the modifications listed in 3.2.

[3.7] steal                                                     
      =========================================================================

STEAL directives, except Steal Heart, are physical attacks with the 
following success formula:

               success% =  (Caster's Speed + K) * (evasion factor)

K is a constant that varies for the different STEAL commands:

COMMAND          K  EVADE  NOTES
--------------- --- -----  -----------------------------------
Steal Helmet     40  yes
Steal Armor      35  yes
Steal Shield     35  yes
Steal Weapon     30  yes
Steal Accessory  40  yes
Steal Exp.       70   no   exp stolen = min{C_Sp + 5, T_Exp}
Gil Taking       90  yes   gil taken = C_Lv * C_Sp
--------------------------------------------------------------
Steal Heart      --   no   neutral MOD 1: success% = C_MA + 50

All of the above attacks are subject to MOD 4 modifiers (see section 3.2
for details).

Evasion applies to all STEAL attacks except Steal Exp. and Steal Heart. 
Steal Heart uses a different scheme entirely (it is a neutral attack, 
not subject to evade, with base success percent equal to caster's MA + 50).

[3.8] punch art                                                              
      =========================================================================

PUNCH ART commands are physical attacks -- even Secret Fist, which uses MA in 
its success formula. For formulas that use PA more than once, the instance of
PA that is modified is marked with a '!'. Spin Fist, Repeating Fist, Wave Fist,
and Earth Slash can all score critical hits (~5% rate).

COMMAND        RESULT                                      MOD EVADE
-------        ------------------------------------------  --- -----
Spin Fist      damage = PA! * [PA / 2]                      2  yes
Repeating Fist damage = (1..9) * (PA! + [PA / 2])           2  yes
Wave Fist      damage = PA! * ([PA / 2] + 1)                2  yes
Earth Slash    damage = PA! * [PA / 2]   {earth}            2  no
Secret Fist    success% = MA + 50                           3  no
Stigma Magic   success% = PA + 120                          3  no
Chakra         recovery = (5 * PA) HP; [(5 * PA) / 2] MP    2  no
Revive         success% = PA+70; recovery = RU{T_MaxHP/5}   3  no

[3.9] draw out                                                               
      =========================================================================

Damage-causing DRAW OUT skills are magical attacks, while Murasame and the
status-adding DRAW OUT skills are neutral attacks. Here are the damage 
formulas:

SKILL NAME      RESULT {range/effect}
--------------  -------------------------------------------------------------
Asura           Damage: 8 * MA {A/3v3e}
Koutetsu        Damage: 12 * MA {A/3v3e}
Bizen Boat      Damage to MP = 4 * MA {A/3v3e}
Murasame        Restore HP: 12 * MA {A/3v3a}, unaffected by compatibility
Heaven's Cloud  Damage: 14 * MA, ~25% add: Slow {A/3v3e}
Kiyomori        Add: Protect and Shell (100%) {A/3v3a}
Muramasa        Damage: 18 * MA, ~25% add: Confusion/Death Sentence {A/3v3e}
Kikuichimoji    Damage: 16 * MA {4dir/8v3e}
Masamune        Add: Regen and Haste (100%) {A/3v3a}
Chirijiraden    Damage: 30 * MA {A/3v3e}

Damage-causing DRAW OUT attacks are MOD 5, while Murasame, Kiyomori, and
Masamune are MOD 0 (see section 3.3 for details).

DRAW OUT attacks have a 100% success rate and ignore evade percentages.

When you use a DRAW OUT attack, one of the corresponding katana in your 
inventory may break. The probability of this happening is approximately 15% 
(thanks to Goryus for this number). You must have at least 1 of the 
corresponding katana in your inventory (unequipped) in order to use any 
DRAW OUT attack.

[3.10] talk skill                                                             
       ========================================================================

For TALK SKILL commands, the base success rate is equal to (Caster's MA + K),
where K is an attribute of each TALK SKILL command:

COMMAND         K    EFFECT
--------------  --   --------------------------------------------
Invitation      20   Add: Invite
Persuade        30   Target's CT set to zero
Praise          50   Target's Brave +4
Threaten        90   Target's Brave -20
Preach          50   Target's Faith +4
Solution        90   Target's Faith -20
Death Sentence  30   Add: Death Sentence
Negotiate       90   Steal ((Caster's Lv) * (Caster's Speed)) gil
Insult          40   Add: Berserk
Mimic Daravon   40   Add: Sleep

Despite using MA, TALK SKILL attacks are neutral MOD 1 attacks (see section 
3.2 for details), and cannot be evaded.

TALK SKILL will have a 00% success rate if the target has Sleep status,
and cannot be used if the caster has Silence status.

TALK SKILL will miss on monsters unless the caster has the Monster Talk
support ability (Mediators have this inherently).

       ========================================================================
      
These include attacks from the DARK SWORD, HOLY SWORD, and MIGHTY SWORD 
skillsets. They are MOD 2 physical attacks with base damage determined as 
follows:
 
                             damage = PA * (WP + K) 

COMMAND         K   ADDITIONAL EFFECTS
--------------- -   ------------------------------------------------------
Dark Sword      0   MP drain                   
Night Sword     0   HP drain (undead reversal)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stasis Sword    2   Add: Stop (25%) 
Crush Punch     2   Add: Dead (25%) 
Split Punch     3   Add: Death Sentence (25%) 
Lightning Stab  4   Add: Silence (25%) 
Holy Explosion  5   Add: Confusion (25%) 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shellbust Stab  0   Break target's equipped as armor (100%)
Blastar Punch   0   Break target's helmet (100%)
Hellcry Punch   0   Break target's weapon (100%)
Icewolf Bite    0   Break target's acccessory (100%)

DARK SWORD will drain (PA * WP) regardless of the target's current HP/MP 
total -- i.e., you can drain more HP/MP than the target has remaining.

MIGHTY SWORD breaks the item in question 100% of the time, and has a 
0% success rate if the target is not equipped with an appropriate item 
for the MIGHTY SWORD skill to break. Consequently, all monsters are 
unaffected by MIGHTY SWORD.

Sword skills are not affected by evade percentages. They will
always succeed (except for MIGHTY SWORD, which will never succeed
if the target is not equipped with the type of equipment that the
skill breaks).

Despite what the in-game help says, all sword skills are WEAPON-ELEMENTAL, 
meaning that they take on the elemental of the equipped weapon, if it has
any. If the equipped weapon is non-elemental, then sword skills using that
weapon are non-elemental. However, the AI thinks that HOLY SWORD skills
are Holy-elemental. You can use this to your advantage: if you wear Holy-
absorbing or nullifying equipment, then the AI will not target HOLY SWORD
skills on you.

[3.12] truth and un-truth                                                     
       ========================================================================

-----
TRUTH
-----
                                   
The Heaven Knight's TRUTH spells are dependent on only the MA of the caster.  
All TRUTH spells have a range/effect of {4/2v3} and will fire a random number 
of times (between 1 and 6, inclusive) at random squares in the affected region.

SPELL NAME      EFFECT
--------------  ---------------------------------------------------------------
Heaven Thunder  Damage: [(MA + 8) / 2] * MA (Lightning)
Asura           Damage: [(MA + 9) / 2] * MA (Fire)
Diamond Sword   Damage: [(MA + 10) / 2] * MA (Wind)
Hydragon Pit    Damage: [(MA + 12) / 2] * MA (Water)
Space Storage   Damage: [(MA + 6) / 2] * MA (may add any one of the following: 
                        Darkness, Confusion, Silence, Frog, Poison, Slow, 
                        or Sleep)
Sky Demon       Damage: [(MA + 20) / 2] * MA (Earth)

Space Storage will add a status ailment roughly 6.25% of the time.

--------
UN-TRUTH
--------

The Hell Knight's UN-TRUTH attacks show a reverse Faith dependence: they do
more damage when the target and caster have low Faith. We can think of the
formula in terms of a new intermediate stat, the 'faith multiplier' (FM).
Normally, FM = Fa. But for UN-TRUTH, FM = (100 - Fa). 
                                
UN-TRUTH is then a MOD 5 magical attack with damage determined by this
formula:

     damage = [(CasterFM * TargetFM * [(MA + Q) / 2] * MA!) / 10000]

where CasterFM is the caster's UN-TRUTH faith multiplier (100 - Fa)
      TargetFM is the target's UN-TRUTH faith multiplier (100 - Fa)
      MA is the caster's MA
      K is a constant multiplier dependent on the spell being cast
         (see the table below for values of Q).
      ! indicates the instance of MA that is modified 

The UN-TRUTH formula reveals that the real effect of Faith status is to
set FM = 100, and the real effect of Innocent status is to set FM = 0.
UN-TRUTH will do zero damage if either caster or target has Innocent
status, and any unit with Faith status acts as if they have 0 Faith as
far as UN-TRUTH is concerned (because the true effect of Faith status 
is to set FM = 100).

The range and effect of all UN-TRUTH spells is the same as that of
their TRUTH counterparts:  {4/2v3}, hitting a random number of times
on random squares of the affected area.

SPELL NAME           Q-VALUE & OTHER PROPERTIES

Heaven Thunder Back  27 (Lightning)
Asura Back           30 (Fire)

                                  Poison, Slow, or Sleep)
Sky Demon Back       60 (Earth)

The chance of Space Storage Back adding a status ailment is about 6.25%.

The Soldier's LIMIT skillset consists mostly of MOD 5 magical attacks. Unlike
most charging magical attacks, though, LIMIT attacks can only be targeted on
panels, not on units. In addition, a Materia Blade must be equipped to use any
LIMIT skill.

[4.1] reaction abilities
      =========================================================================

I've divided reaction abilities into five groups, based on how they are
triggered: pseudo-support abilities, damage-triggered abilities, countergrasp 
abilities, abilities activated when critical, and other abilities.

No reaction abilities will activate if the reacting unit is afflicted with
any of the following status changes: Berserk, Blood Suck, Don't Act, Sleep, 
Confusion, Stop.

PSEUDO-SUPPORT ABILITIES:  These reaction abilities act more like support
abilities, in that they do not depend on Brave, nor do they require a specific 
trigger to activate -- essentially, they are always active if set.  These are
good choices for low-Brave units.

    [Abandon] - 400 JP, Ninja  
    This ability doubles all inherent, shield, accessory, and weapon evade 
    percentages.  That is, instead of (1 - Ev), each evasion stat contributes a
    multiplier of (1 - 2*Ev) to the success percent equation for evadable 
    attacks.

    [Weapon Guard] - 200 JP, Knight
    This ability enables your weapon evasion (WEv).

DAMAGE-TRIGGERED ABILTIES:  These abilities are triggered if you receive
HP damage (including 0 damage) from any OTHER unit.  They will trigger 
(Brave)% of the time.

    [A Save] - 550 JP, Dancer
    Your PA increases by 1.

    [Auto Potion] - 400 JP, Chemist
    Use a Potion (recovers 30 HP). If you have no Potions in stock, use a 
    Hi-Potion (recovers 70 HP). If you have no Hi-Potions in stock, use an 
    X-Potion (recovers 150 HP). If you have none of these potions in stock, 
    the ability has no effect.

    [Caution] - 200 JP, Thief
    You gain Defending status. This will expire on your next active turn.
     
    [Damage Split] - 300 JP, Calculator
    The unit that damaged you will take RU{damage / 2} damage and you will 
    recover RU{damage / 2} HP. (Will only trigger if damage > 0.)

    [Gilgame Heart] - 200 JP, Thief
    Steal (Damage * 10) gil from the enemy, where Damage is the amount of 
    damage that was just done to you.

    [MA Save] - 450 JP, Bard)
    Your MA increases by 1.

    [Regenerator] - 400 JP, Priest
    You gain Regen status. Like standard Regen, this will expire in 32
    clockticks.

    [Speed Save] - 800 JP, Archer
    Your Speed increases by 1.

COUNTERGRASP:  So called from the two most popular reaction abilities of
this class, Counter and Blade Grasp, these attacks will be triggered by
any of the physical attacks listed below. The attack does not have to
succeed or cause damage in order for the reaction ability to activate.
Like most reaction abilities, these will activate Br% of the time.

           ------------LIST OF COUNTERGRASP ACTIVATORS-------------
          |========================================================|
          |  ATTACK*           Eye Gouge         Beaking           |

          |  Goblin Punch      Beak                                |
          |                                                        |
          |  * Countergrasp reactions (except Blade Grasp) do not  |
          |    work against ATTACKs with magic guns                |
          |  ** Vampire version of 'Blood Suck' only!              |
           --------------------------------------------------------

    [Blade Grasp] - 700 JP, Samurai  
    This ability makes the base hit percentage for Countergrasp 
    activators executed against you equal to (Base - YourBr) instead of 
    Base, where Base is the success rate of the attack before evasion
    is considered.  Unlike the other Countergrasp reaction abilities, 
    Blade Grasp DOES work against magic guns.  Blade Grasp can only 
    activate once per attack, so it will at most block one of the two 
    hits from a Two Swords attack.  Blade Grasp is NOT considered to 
    be evasion, and its effects stack with those of evasion. See 
    section 6.6 for details.

    [Brave Up] - 500 JP, Dancer
    Your Br is increased by 3.

    [Counter] - 300 JP, Monk
    If the unit which attacked you is within range of your equipped 
    weapon, you will counter with an ATTACK directive. The Counter-ATTACK
    can't trigger reactions (except pseudo-supports), which means it can't
    be blocked by Blade Grasp.

    [Counter Tackle] - 180 JP, Squire
    If the unit that attacked you is within range of 'Dash', you will 
    counter with 'Dash'.

    [Dragon Spirit] - 560 JP, Lancer  
    You gain Reraise status, unless you already have Reraise or are immune 
    to Reraise.

    [Sunken State] - 900 JP, Ninja 
    You gain Transparent status, unless you are immune to Transparent.

ABILITIES ACTIVATED WHEN IN CRITICAL STATUS:  These abilities will 
activate Br% of the time if you receive HP damage (including 0 damage)
from ANOTHER unit and are in Critical status after that damage 
resolves. It doesn't matter whether you were Critical before the damage 
was dealt.

    [Critical Quick] - 700 JP, Time Mage
    You gain Quick status -- specifically, you are tagged with a critical 
    quick-flag.  This ability can be used to set up 'The Quickening', 
    which allows your units to get infinite turns.  See Shinmen Takazo's 
    excellent Quickening FAQ on gamefaqs.com for details.

    [HP Restore] - 500 JP, Monk
    Restore (your MaxHP - your CurrentHP) HP. (In other words,
    restore your HP to maximum.)

    [Meatbone Slash] - 200 JP, Samurai
    If the attacker is within range of your weapon, you will counter
    with 'Meatbone Slash', a neutral MOD 0 attack that deals damage 
    equal to your Max HP.

    [MP Restore] - 400 JP, Summoner
    Restore (your MaxMP - your CurrentMP) MP. (In other words,
    restore your MP to maximum.)

OTHER REACTION ABILITIES:  These don't fit in any category.

    [Absorb Used MP] - 250 JP, Oracle 
    Whenever another unit uses an ability that costs MP, and you are 
    one of the targets, you have a Br% chance of gaining the amount 
    of MP that the other unit consumed.

    [Arrow Guard] - 450 JP, Archer  
    This is like Blade Grasp, but it only works on bow and crossbow 
    attacks (this includes ATTACK, CHARGE, BATTLE SKILL, and SNIPE, 
    with bow or crossbow equipped).  See 'Blade Grasp'.

    [Catch] - 200 JP, Thief  
    If you are targeted with a THROW attack, you will catch the 
    item and add it to your inventory Br% of the time. The message 
    'Caught' will be displayed in red upon a successful Catch.  
    Mimed THROW attacks cannot be Caught (I guess this is because no 
    'real' item is consumed for a mimed THROW).

    [Counter Flood] - 300 JP, Geomancer  
    If you are targeted by a Counter Flood-enabled attack (Check 
    the big list (section 3.3) to see if an attack is Counter Flood-
    enabled. For the most part, these are Countergraspable attacks 
    that also cause damage, plus ELEMENTAL attacks and some other 
    oddballs), you will counter with an ELEMENTAL directive 
    corresponding to the ground you are currently standing on, 
    regardless of your assailant's distance from you and regardless of 
    whether you have actually learned that ability. The ELEMENTAL 
    directive will have its usual effect area, so if one of your units 
    happens to be standing next to the target of Counter Flood and is 
    on the same height, (s)he'll be damaged too!  Like most reactions, 
    Counter Flood will activate Br% of the time.

    [Counter Magic] - 800 JP, Wizard 
    If you are targeted by a magic gun or a spell that is subject to 
    Counter Magic (see the big list in section 3.3), you will cast that 
    spell back at the caster, paying the appropriate MP cost.  This 
    will activate Br% of the time and only if you have sufficient MP
    to cast the spell.

    [Distribute] - 200 JP, Calculator  
    If you are healed by another unit (this ability does NOT activate if 
    you are healing yourself!), every allied unit that does not have full 
    HP will gain RU{(gained_HP - (maxHP - curHP)) / N}, where gained_HP 
    is the magnitude of the triggering HP gain, maxHP is your maximum HP, 
    curHP was your current HP before the HP gain, and N is the number of 
    allied units that do not have full HP. (In other words, any excess 
    healing will be split equally (round up) among all other party 
    members that are not at full HP.  Note that only one unit's healing 
    will be shown in the animation, but all units that do not have full
    HP will be healed.)  This ability will activate Br% of the time.

    [Face Up] - 500 JP, Bard  
    If you are targeted by any Faith-based magical attack, this 
    ability will increase your Faith by 3. It works Br% of the time.

    [Finger Guard] - 300 JP, Mediator  
    Base success percentage of TALK SKILL attacks executed against 
    you is now equal to (Base% - YourBr%).
       
    [Hamedo] - 1200 JP, Monk  
    If you are targeted by an ATTACK, BATTLE SKILL, THROW, or CHARGE 
    directive and your attacker is within range of your weapon, the 
    attacker's directive will be cancelled and you will instead 
    execute an ATTACK directive on the attacker.  The Hamedo-ATTACK
    cannot trigger reactions (except for pseudo-supports).  Note that 
    this only works on the above-listed commands, which means it is 
    useless on monsters, since they have special forms of physical 
    attack. (And even though Berserk units can only ATTACK, Hamedo
    still doesn't work on Berserked monsters.) This ability will 
    trigger Br% of the time.  Note: unlike Counter, Hamedo will
    activate against spell guns.

    [MP Switch] - 400 JP, Time Mage  
    If you receive HP damage and your CurMP > 0, the damage will 
    instead be dealt to your MP Br% of the time.  This works on 
    almost _any_ source of damage, including Poison, falling damage,
    and self-inflicted damage.  It does not, however, work on damage 
    incurred by other reaction abilities like Hamedo, Counter, and 
    Meatbone Slash.

    [Reflect] - 200 JP, GameShark only  
    This has no effect.


_______________________________________________________________________________
[4.2] support abilities
      =========================================================================

Unlike most reaction abilities, support abilities are always active while 
they are equipped.

[Attack UP] - 400 JP, Geomancer  
For physical attacks except JUMP and some others (see 3.3), the effective 
value of your relevant stat XA = [XA * 4/3].  Usually, XA is PA, but it 
can sometimes be MA (as in a stick ATTACK), Speed (as in a STEAL directive),
or a complex expression like [(PA + MA) / 2] (as in a dictionary ATTACK).  
Check the list in section 3.3 to see whether an attack is physical. 

[Concentrate] - 400 JP, Archer  
Targets cannot evade your physical attacks via their evasion percentages 
(P.CEV, P.SEV, P.AEV, W-EV).  Note that this does not guarantee 100% success 
on attacks such as BATTLE SKILL, since these attacks can still MISS.  Targets 
may also still evade using the 'Blade Grasp' and 'Arrow Guard' abilities.
Concentrate has no effect on magic evasion.

[Defend] - 50 JP, Squire  
Adds the DEFEND command (add: Defending on the caster) to your action menu.

[Defense UP] - 400 JP, Oracle 
For physical attacks except JUMP and some others (see 3.3), units attacking 
you receive a penalty to their relevant stat XA such that XA = [XA * 2/3].
Usually, stat XA is PA, but it can sometimes be MA (as in a stick ATTACK), 
Speed (as in THROW), WP (as in a gun ATTACK), or a complex expression like
[(PA + MA) / 2] (as in a dictionary ATTACK). Check the list in section 3.3 
to see whether an attack is physical.

[Equip Armor] - 500 JP, Knight  
You can equip armor and helmets regardless of your current job.

[Equip Axe] - 200 JP, Squire
You can equip axes regardless of your current job.

[Equip Change] - 0 JP, Chemist
Adds the EQUIP CHANGE command to your action menu.  This allows you to 
change your equipment in battle.  Using EQUIP CHANGE counts as an
action.

such that received Exp = earned Exp * 2.

[Gained JP-UP] - 200 JP, Squire
When you receive JP for an action, you receive bonus JP such that received
JP = [earned JP * 3/2].

[Half of MP] - 900 JP, Summoner
Any MP-using ability costs you half as many MP to use (round up). 
(HalfMPCost = RU{MPCost / 2})

[Magic AttackUP] - 400 JP, Wizard  
For magical attacks, the effective value of your MA = [MA * 4/3].  
This does not include physical attacks (such as stick and staff ATTACK) 
that use MA as their relevant stat. Check the list in section 3.3 to see 
whether an attack is magical. 

[Magic DefendUP] - 400 JP, Priest  
For magical attacks targeting you, the effective value of the caster's 
MA = [MA * 2/3].  This does not include physical attacks (such as stick and
staff ATTACK) which use MA as their relevant stat. Check the list in section
3.3 to see whether an attack is magical. 
 
[Maintenance] - 250 JP, Chemist
Your equipment cannot be stolen or broken.  Any attack that steals or 
breaks equipment will have a 0% success rate if targeted against you.

[Martial Arts] - 200 JP, Monk
Your effective XA for all physical attacks except JUMP and THROW is equal 
to [XA * 3/2].  If you are not barehanded, those physical attacks that 
are weapon-elemental (ATTACK, CHARGE, BATTLE SKILL, SNIPE, sword skills) 
will not receive the bonus.

[Monster Skill] - 200 JP, Squire
Monsters standing on squares adjacent to you will have access to a new 
skill (vertical tolerance 3).  This will have no effect if you are
Berserk, Confused, or Unable to Fight.

[Monster Talk] - 100 JP, Mediator
Enables you to target TALK SKILL on monsters, regardless of your job.

[Non-charge] - 3000 JP, GameShark only
All slow actions, except for JUMP, CHARGE, SING, and DANCE, become fast 
actions.

[Secret Hunt] - 200 JP, Thief
If you kill a monster with damage from your weapon (i.e., through ATTACK, 
CHARGE or Counter), you will poach it; that is, it will be transformed 
into an item that you can buy at one of the Fur Shops located around Ivalice.
Items bought at the Fur Shop will be half their normal price! Also, you can
sell any item to the Fur Shop to raise some quick cash, and then later buy 
it back for the same amount you sold it for!

[Short Charge] - 800 JP, Time Mage
For all slow actions except for JUMP, CHARGE, SING and DANCE, 
ctr = RU{ctr/2}.

[Throw Item] - 350 JP, Chemist 
Range of ITEM becomes 4/1 (line of sight), regardless of your current job.

[Train] - 450 JP, Mediator  
If you strike a monster directly with your weapon (e,g., through ATTACK, 
CHARGE, or Counter), and that monster is Critical after the attack 
resolves, you will also add: Invite to that same monster.

[Two Hands] - 900 JP, Samurai
You are able to grip one-handed weapons with both hands, doubling 
weapon power (does not apply to non-striking weapons like guns and 
crossbows).  Weapon power is doubled for the ATTACK command only and 
does not affect other physical attacks -- even those that employ weapons 
such as JUMP, BATTLE SKILL, HOLY SWORD, DARK SWORD and MIGHTY SWORD. 
(It does apply, however, to the ATTACK that results from targetting a 
BATTLE SKILL on a piece of equipment that the target does not have.)

[Two Swords] - 900 JP, Ninja  
You are able to equip two one-handed weapons at once.  This has some 
interesting upshots -- for instance, all BATTLE SKILL, CHARGE, and 
SNIPE directives are executed twice if you are carrying two weapons.
In addition, if you attack a target that has Blade Grasp set, 
Blade Grasp can only block one of the two hits that you incur.  If
the first hit of a Two Sworded attack fails to connect for any 
reason (evade, Blade Grasp, or inherent inaccuracy of the attack), 
then the target will turn to face the attacker prior to the second 
hit, and the second hit will be treated as if it were executed 
from the front (i.e., all possible evade parameters will be 
considered).


_______________________________________________________________________________
[4.3] movement abilities
      =========================================================================

Movement abilities allow you to move about the battlefield more easily, or
activate special powers when you move.

[Any Ground] - 220 JP, Geomancer 
Normally each square of flowing water you walk through costs you two movement 
points instead of one.  With this ability, the movement penalty to walk through
flowing water vanishes.

[Any Weather] - 200 JP, Oracle
Normally, you can walk over marsh sqaures without suffering the water penalty.
However, if it is raining heavily in a marshland, you will face a similar 
penalty -- you must use two movement points for every square of marsh you 
move over.  If you have Any Weather equipped, that penalty will not take 
effect.  In addition, weather effects on magic (increase in Lightning damage 
and decrease in Fire damage during thunderstorms) are nullified if the caster
has Any Weather.  This is in a heated battle with Move on Lava for the title
of 'most useless ability'. And another curiosity:  the programmers gave the 
Steel Giant class Any Ground and Any Weather inherent, but they also gave 
it Cannot enter water inherent, making Any Ground and Any Weather completely
useless! Maybe they intended to program more weather and terrain effects 
into the game but never got around to it.

[Cannot enter water] - 200 JP, inherent for several monsters)
You cannot move or stop on squares that are submerged in water.

[Float] - 540 JP, Time Mage 
You float 1h above the ground. This has the same effect as the Float status,
except that it allows you to stop on lava squares (the Float status only 
allows you to move, not stop, over lava).

[Fly] - 1200 JP, Bard and Dancer
Allows you to fly over all height differences, enemies, and obstacles.
Nullifies fall damage.

[Ignore Height] - 700 JP, Lancer
You are able to jump to any vertical height, regardless of your 'Jump' 
stat.  This has no effect on the Lancer's JUMP command.

[Jump +1] - 200 JP, Archer
'Jump' stat + 1.  This has no effect on the Lancer's JUMP command.

[Jump +2] - 480 JP, Thief  
'Jump' stat + 2.  This has no effect on the Lancer's JUMP command.

[Jump +3] - 1000 JP, Dancer
'Jump' stat + 3.  This has no effect on the Lancer's JUMP command.

[Move +1] - 200 JP, Squire

[Move +2] - 520 JP, Thief
'Move' stat + 2.

[Move +3] - 1000 JP, Bard
'Move' stat + 3.

[Move in Water] - 420 JP, Ninja
You can move (and stop) on top of water; water is treated like 
normal ground.

[Move on Lava] - 150 JP, Geomancer
You can move (and stop) on top of lava; lava is treated like 
normal ground.

[Move Undrwater] - 200 JP, inherent for Mindflayer type monsters 
You can move (and stop) in water up to 3h deep without penalty. 

[Move-Find Item] - 100 JP, Chemist
You can extract hidden items from booby-trapped squares without
triggering the traps. Each square has two items: the odds of getting
one (usually the commoner item) are Br%, and the odds of getting the
other (usually the rarer item) are (100 - Br)%.

[Move-Get Exp] - 400 JP, Calculator
You gain 1 Exp. per panel moved, unless you are afflicted with 
Berserk, Confusion, or Blood Suck status.

[Move-Get JP] - 360 JP, Calculator
You gain 2 JP per panel moved, unless you are afflicted with 
Berserk, Confusion, or Blood Suck status.

[Move-HP Up] - 300 JP, Monk
Recover RU{MaxHP / 10} HP if you move at least one panel, unless 
you are afflicted with Berserk, Confusion, or Blood Suck status.

[Move-MP Up] - 350 JP, Oracle
Recover RU{MaxMP / 10} MP if you move at least one panel, unless 
you are afflicted with Berserk, Confusion, or Blood Suck status.

[Silent Walk] - 700 JP, GameShark only
No known effect.

[Teleport] - 600 JP, Time Mage
Able to teleport through obstacles, height differences, units, etc.  
Chance of success is 100% within your Move range and decreases 10% 
per extra square you move.  See section 6.7 for details.

[Teleport 2] - 0 JP, inherent for Arch Angel, Holy Angel 
Teleport anywhere on the battlefield with 100% success.

[Walk on Water] - 300 JP, Samurai
Ignore water depth; all water is treated like it is 1h deep, 
regardless of actual depth. (Doesn't it seem like this should be
called Move in Water, and Move in Water should be called 
Walk on Water?)

         *********************************************************
         > Jjukil <jjukil@excite.com> provided a lot of 
           information on the Frog status.
         *********************************************************

There are five types of status alterations in Final Fantasy Tactics:  
preparative, supportive, negative, damaged-derived, and miscellaneous.  
Below are summaries of all the status ailments, the effects
they have on your units, and how they can be identified.

Abbrevations:
DO   - identifies a DRAW OUT technique
MS   - identifies a MAGIC SWORD technique
(25) - status is randomly added to the target of this ability
       or weapon. rate of status addition is ~25%.
(6)  - status is randomly added to the target of this ability
       or weapon. rate of status addition is ~6.25%.
(R)  - status is added as a reaction ability
(A)  - this item confers Auto-status
(1)  - character starts battle with this status when this item is equipped

The 'Duration:' category indicates the length of time that the status
will remain in effect if left to its own devices (i.e., if the character
is targeted by no spells or effects that add, remove, or cancel out that
status).  See section A.2 for definitions of the phases of battle and of
'clockticks'.  'Infinite' in this category means the effect will last
the entire battle; all effects except 'Invite' and 'Morbol' will wear
off at the end of battle.

An ability in [brackets] indicates that the ability can only target a
certain type of unit (e.g., [Dragon Tame] only affects Dragons and Hydras).
Look the ability up in section 3.3 for more details.

Auto-statuses, set by pieces of equipment like Excalibur (Auto-Haste) and
Robe of Lords (Auto-Protect, Auto-Shell), cannot be removed unless the
equipment is de-equipped, broken, or stolen.  If a unit with an Auto-status
(e.g., Auto-Regen) is afflicted with another status that normally would 
cancel the first (e.g., Poison), the second status will take effect for its
normal duration (e.g., 35 clockticks) and then the first status will return.
During the period that the second status is in effect, both statuses will
technically be set, but only the second status will be 'expressed'.
If an item that imparts an Auto-status is equipped in battle via 
Equip Change,the status will take effect immediately and last until the 
equipment is de-equiped, broken, or stolen. Auto-statuses are not subject 
to clocktick limits.

Initial-statuses, set by equipment like the Angel Ring (Initial-Reraise)
and the Stone Gun (Initial-Petrify) take effect at the beginning of battle
and can be removed as normal. If an item that imparts an Initial-status is
equipped in battle via Equip Change, the status will NOT take effect.

To find a status by name, search for the name between [square brackets].


_______________________________________________________________________________
[5.1] preparative status changes
      =========================================================================

These status changes occur when a character is preparing to execute an action.
They will be cancelled when the action is executed or (at your option) at the
character's next AT.

[Charging]
Appearance:  'C' in a starburst above character's head
Description:  This status occurs when a character is charging up a slow-action.
When a character is in 'Charging' status, his evade percentages will all drop 
to 0%, and all units attacking him physically will receive a bonus to their PA 
(new PA = [PA * 3/2]) (i.e., the charging character will take about 1.5 times 
as much damage from physical attacks, and physical abilities which cause non-
damaging effects (e.g., BATTLE SKILL) will have a higher chance of working). 
Add with:  Initiate spell-casting or CHARGE directive
Cancel with:  Execute directive; cancel on next AT; 
              add Berserk; add Blood Suck
Duration:  until the S+ phase when the slow-action is resolved. 

[Defending]
Appearance:  Arms crossed in defensive stance
Description:  This status is activated when the 'Defend' command is selected.
When a character is 'Defending', his evade percentages will all be doubled.
Note: if the character also has 'Abandon', his evade percentages will be 
quadrupled.  If a chracter with Abandon is defending and is attacked by a
character with Darkness, his evade percentages will be octupled!
Add with:  DEFEND, Caution (R)
Cancel with:  cancelled on next AT; add Berserk; add Blood Suck
Duration:  one turn

[Performing]
Appearance:  Character is singing or dancing
Description:  This status is activated when a SING or DANCE directive is
selected.  When a character is 'Performing', his evade percentages will all
drop to 0%.
Add with:  SING, DANCE
Cancel with:  cancellation of SING or DANCE directive; add Berserk;
              add Blood Suck
Duration:  player-determined


_______________________________________________________________________________
[5.2] supportive status changes
      =========================================================================

These status changes will afford special abilities or protections to your
characters. 

[Float]
Appearance:  Character is floating 1h above the ground
Description:  This status is invoked by the 'Float' spell, the accessory
'Feather Boots', or the Move ability, 'Float'.  Characters with 'Float' 
will act as if they are stationed 1h above where they are actually
standing.  For example, if a character with Float is standing at height
9, and there is a character at height 7 trying to attack the floating
character with an attack which has a vertical tolerance of 2, he will
be unable to do so because the floater will behave as if he were 
standing at height 10.  In addition, floating characters can move over
rugged terrain such as lava and water without penalty to their
movement, and are unaffected by other terrain-based penalties such as
the inability to move in water of depth 2h or greater (a character with
'Float' will float 1h above the water level).  Furthermore, floating
characters are immune to Earth-elemental attacks.  Characters with the
'Float' movement ability (but _not_ those who received the status from
the boots, the Cherche, or from the TIME MAGIC), will be able to stop 
over lava.
Add with:  Float (TIME MAGIC), Feather Boots (A), Cherche (A), Float (M) 
Cancel with:  Dispel Magic, Despair, Despair 2, Odd Soundwave
Duration:  infinite

[Haste]
Appearance:  Animation is sped up
Description:  Effective Speed = [Speed * 3/2].  Note that this is 
only applied in CT incrementing, and has no effect on formulas that 
depend on Speed, such as the damage for the THROW directive or an 
ATTACK with a longbow.  Haste also has no effect on the charge time
of a JUMP directive.
Cancels:   Slow
Add with:  Haste, Haste 2, MBarrier, DO Masamune, Excalibur (A), 
           Setiemson (A), Nameless Song
Cancel with:  Dispel Magic, Despair, Despair 2, Odd Soundwave, 
              add Slow
Duration:  32 clockticks

[Protect]
Appearance:  Triangle in dialogue balloon above character's head
Description:  Reduces physical damage by one-third.  More precisely,
any unit attacking the Protected unit with a physical attack will 
receive a PA penalty such that (revised PA) = [PA * 2/3]. 
Also note that though PA is the stat usually modified by Protect,
it doesn't _have_ to be.  Some physical attacks calculate damage
or success rate based on MA or Speed.  For these attacks, Protect
acts as above, except replace 'PA' with 'MA' or 'Speed'.  In
addition, physical attacks that have stat-dependent success rates
(e.g., BATTLE SKILL, STEAL) will face a penalty such that 
revised stat = [stat * 2/3] when targeting a Protected unit;
consequently, Protect can lower either the success rate or the
damage of physical attacks.  Unless it is imparted by an item, 
Protect will wear off on its own after a time.
Add with:  Protect, Protect 2, Wall, MBarrier, Protect Spirit,
           DO Kiyomori, Salty Rage (A), Save the Queen (A),
           Robe of Lords (A), Nameless Song
Cancel with:  Dispel Magic, Despair, Despair 2, Odd Soundwave
Duration:  32 clockticks

[Regen]
Appearance:  Character has a bluish glow
Description:  At the end of every AT, a character with Regen will gain
back [MaxHP / 8] HP.  Regen will wear off on its own after a time 
unless it is imparted by an item.
Cancels:   Poison
Add with:  Regen, MBarrier, DO Masamune, Chaos Blade (A), Chantage (A),
           Regenerator (R), Nameless Song
Cancel with:  Dispel Magic, Despair, Despair 2, Odd Soundwave, add Poison
Duration:  36 clockticks

[Reraise]
Appearance:  Angel hovering above character's head
Description:  If character is put into 'Dead' status, he will be revived
with RU{MaxHP/10} on what would be his first AT after dying.  Reraise is 
cancelled when a character is revived by it. If an Undead character has
Reraise (this can only be accomplished with Auto-Reraise), Reraise will
have no effect other than to prevent you from seeing the Dead counter, 
and to block the 50% chance of auto-revival normally associated with
Undead status. 
Blocks:    Undead
Add with:  Reraise, MBarrier, Angel Ring (1), Chantage (A), 
           Dragon Spirit (R), Nameless Song
Cancel with:  Dispel Magic, Despair, Despair 2, Odd Soundwave,
Duration:  until revival, one AT after Dead is added


[Shell]
Appearance:  Square in dialogue balloon above character's head
Description:  The caster of magical attacks against a unit will Shell
will have his or her MA reduced to [MA * 2/3].  This in effect reduces
the damage or success rate of magical attacks executed against the unit
with Shell.  Note that Shell does NOT affect damage from spells that 
subtract a certain percentage of the target's HP (such as Demi, Lich 
and Life Drain), though it may affect the success rate of these spells.  
Unless imparted by an item, Shell will wear off on its own after a time.
Add with:  Shell, Shell 2, Wall, MBarrier, DO Kiyomori, Clam Spirit,
           Ragnarok (A), Salty Rage (A), Robe of Lords (A), Nameless Song
Cancel with:  Dispel Magic, Despair, Despair 2, Odd Soundwave
Duration:  32 clockticks

[Transparent]
Appearance:  Character is translucent
Description:  Character is ignored by computer-controlled units.  Attacks
made by a Transparent character ignore all evade percentages -- physical
AND magical.  Transparent is cancelled at the end of any AT during which
the Transparent character takes an action or the Transparent character
takes any damage.
Add with:  Sunken State (R), Secret Clothes (1), Vanish Mantle (1),
           Setiemson (1)
Cancel with:  Dispel Magic, Despair, Despair 2, Odd Soundwave,
              act with Transparent unit, damage Transparent unit
Duration:  player-determined


_______________________________________________________________________________
[5.3] negative status changes
      =========================================================================

These status changes will weaken your characters or impede them from
battling normally.  

[Blood Suck]
Appearance:  Character is colored purple
Description:  Character is a vampire.  He will be uncontrollable, and 
attack random units with the human version of the 'Blood Suck' [0C8] attack.  
All evade percentages will drop to 0, and character will be unable to use 
reaction abilities and certain move abilities like Move-HP Up and Move-Get Exp.
All monsters are inherently immune to Blood Suck. A unit with Blood Suck is 
considered Unable to Fight. If all units on one team are simultaneously 
Unable to Fight, that team loses the battle.
Cancels:   Charging, Defending, Performing
Add with:  Blood Suck [0C8] (from the BLOOD SUCK command set), 
           Blood Suck [11C] (25%) (from the Vampire's command set)
Cancel with:  Deathspell 2, Holy Water
Block with:  108 Gems, Barette, Ribbon
Duration:  infinite

[Charm]
Appearance:  Heart in dialogue balloon above character's head
Description:  Character perceives enemies as allies, and allies as
enemies. For instance, a Charmed enemy can cast harmful SUMMON MAGIC
on other enemies. However, the (original) allies of a Charmed unit will
NOT perceive it as an enemy. For example, if one of your Summoners 
becomes Charmed, she can cast Shiva on your party while Charmed, but 
other units in your party cannot cast Shiva on her. If a unit on team A
is charmed by a unit on team B, mimes on team A will not mimic
that unit's actions while she is Charmed, but mimes on team B will.
The only effect of Charming an allied unit is to put that unit under
AI control until Charm is removed.
Add with:  Steal Heart, Allure, Fairy Harp (25%)
Cancel with:  HP damage to unit
Block with:  N-Kai Armlet, Barette, Ribbon
Duration:  32 clockticks

[Chicken]
Appearance:  Character is, well... a chicken
Description:  This status is caused by a character having less than 10
Brave.  The character will flee from all foes, and regain 1 Brave per
AT until he reaches 10 Brave, at which point Chicken will be cancelled.
Characters attacking a chicken will receive a PA bonus (usually, new 
PA = [PA * 3/2]) (i.e., Chickens will take about 1.5 times as much 
damage from physical attacks).  Weapon attacks that normally have
a vertical 3 tolerance when attacking from above will only have a
vetical 2 tolerance if the target is a Chicken.
Add with:  lower Brave to 9 or less
Cancel with:  raise Brave to 10
Block with:  nothing
Duration:  the number of turns it takes for Brave to increment to 10

[Confusion]
Appearance:  Awkward movements by character, speech balloon with '?'
Description:  Character will attack the unit closest to it, regardless
of whether that unit is an ally or enemy, with random attacks. Confused
units will also sometimes charge spells on unoccupied panels.  Evasion 
percentages of targets attacked by a Confused unit will be doubled.  
Confusion also prevents the use of reaction abilities and special effect-
generating Move abilities like Move-HP Up and Move-Get Exp.  Confusion will
be cancelled if the afflicted character takes damage.
Add with:     Confusion Song, MS Confuse, Confuse 2, Mind Blast, 
              Nameless Dance, Parasite, Bad Bracelet, Grand Cross, Loss,
              Muramasa (25%), Local Quake (25%), Holy Explosion (25%),
              Ramia Harp (25%)
Cancel with:  Esuna, Remedy, Deathspell 2, Stigma Magic, 
              {Dragon Care}, HP damage
Block with:   N-Kai Armlet, Barette, Ribbon
Duration:     infinite

[Darkness]
Appearance:  Eye with 'x' hovering above character
Description:  For physical attacks executed by a unit with Darkness, 
all targets' evade percentages are doubled. 
Add with:  Blind, MS Blind, Blind 2, Darkness, Eye Gouge, Black Ink,

Frogs' attack damage. (Thanks to Jjukil <Jjukil@excite.com> for this 
detailed information on the Frog status.)  Weapon attacks that normally

Duration:  20 clockticks
           
[Undead]
Appearance:  Character has a magenta tint
Description:  Character becomes undead.  This has several effects:
(1) most attacks which normally restore HP, such as Cure spells, Potions, 
    and the Healing Staff, will instead subtract HP.  Exception:  Chakra 
    will still heal HP.  Even though Cure spells will damage the character, 
    he still will not try to evade them.  HP loss from Cure spells will 
    still trigger damage-dependent reaction abilities, like MP Switch and
    Auto Potion (the latter of which sucks for the Undead unit, since it
    will cause even more damage!). 'Regen' status still works as normal.
(2) 'Reraise' cannot be set on that character. If the character has
    Auto-Reraise (as from Chantage or Angel Ring), then Reraise will remain
    set when Undead is set. If the Undead/Reraised character is killed,
    that character cannot be revived by any means (aside from ending the
    battle).
(3) the 'Death' spell will restore the character to full HP.  The 'Raise'
    spell will subtract [Undead Character's MaxHP / 2] HP.  The 'Raise 2'
    spell will subtract (Undead Character's Remaining HP) Note that though
    Undead absorb 'Death', they are _not_ immune to attacks that add: Dead, 
    such as Stop Bracelet. (The 'Death' spell is special-cased -- it both
    adds Dead AND subtracts (Target's Max HP) HP. The effect of the Undead
    ailment is to (a) remove the add: Dead property from 'Death', and 
    (b) reverse damage from 'Death' into healing.) Undead units will still
    try to evade 'Death', even though it's beneficial to them.
(4) HP-draining attacks, such as Life Drain and Blood Suck, work as
    follows (MP is still drained as normal).

                          effect on  effect on
                  target   caster     target
                  ------  ---------  ---------
                  normal  + HP       - HP
                  undead  - HP       + HP           

    These rules apply whether the caster is normal or whether he is 
    Undead as well.  
(5) when an Undead character has the 'Dead' status, there is a roughly
    50% chance that instead of crystallizing when the countdown runs out, 
    he will be revived with a random amount of HP (CurHP = (1..MaxHP)).
(6) when a 'Death Sentence' runs out on an undead character, it will
    simply cancel 'Death Sentence' rather than adding 'Dead'.
Blocks:    Reraise

Block with:  108 Gems, Cachusha, Ribbon

_______________________________________________________________________________
[5.4] damage-derived status changes
      =========================================================================

These status abnormalities occur when a character has sustained too much
damage in battle.

[Critical]
Appearance:  Character is kneeling
Description:  Character's current HP is less than RU{MaxHP / 5}.  Critical
has no adverse effects per se, but a Critical character is in danger of
dying.  Critical can be cancelled with HP recovery.  Certain reaction 
abilities can only be activated when the reacting unit is in Critical status.
Add with:  HP depletion
Cancel with:  HP recovery
Duration:  infinite

[Dead]
Appearance:  Character is lying on ground
Description:  Character has 0 HP and is incapacitated.  Character does
not get a turn.  When 'Dead' is set, a countdown will begin from 3 and
decrement by 1 at each AT the character would have had.  When the 
countdown reaches -1, the character either turns into a treasure box or
a crystal (50% chance of either outcome), and is removed from the game.  
Not surprisingly, a Dead unit is considered Unable to Fight. If all the
members of a team are simultaneously Unable to Fight, that team loses
the battle. (Interesting side note: because Dead cancels Blood Suck, 
and because Dead is a lot easier to remove than Blood Suck is, killing
a Blood Sucked unit is often the best way to deal with it if you don't 
have any Holy Water handy.)
Cancels:   Berserk, Blood Suck, Confusion, Charm, Charging, Critical, 
           Death Sentence, Defending, Don't Move, Don't Act, Faith,

[5.5] other status changes
      =========================================================================

These are miscellaneous status changes that do not fit into any other
category; they are not intrinsically positive or negative but can
vary depending on the situation.

[Berserk]
Appearance:  Character has a bright red tint and a red star in a
             speech balloon hovering above his head
Description:  Character's effective PA is equal to [PA * 3/2].  
Character is uncontrollable, and will always use the ATTACK

move abilities, such as Move-HP Up and Move-Get Exp.

[Faith]
Appearance:  Arrow up and Glabados cross in a speech balloon above 
             character's head
Description:  Character's Faith is considered to be 100. (exception:  
              UN-TRUTH attacks consider the character's Faith to be 
              zero.)
Cancels:   Innocent
Add with:  Pray Faith, Faith, Faith Rod (25%), Faith Rod (A)
Cancel with:  Dispel Magic, Despair, Despair 2, Odd Soundwave,

[Innocent]
Appearance:  Arrow down and Glabados cross in a speech balloon 
             above character's head
Description:  Character's Faith is considered to be zero. (exception:  
              UN-TRUTH attacks consider the character's Faith to be 
              100.)
Cancels:   Faith
Add with:  Doubt Faith, Innocent, Gokuu Rod (25%)
Cancel with:  add Faith 
Duration:  32 clockticks

[Invite]
Appearance:  none visible
Description:  Character joins the enemy's party (as a Guest).  An 
Invited ally becomes an enemy, and an Invited enemy becomes an ally.  
At the end of the battle, any Invited enemies will be given the chance 
to permanently join the ally party.  Invited units are considered 
Unable to Fight (for their original team). If all the members of a team
are simultaneously Unable to Fight, that team loses the battle.  As far
as I can tell, the AI will never try to Invite your units, even under
Confusion and even if Invite is the only option possible. A unit can 
only be Invited once per battle; units with Invite are immune to Invite.
Blocks:  Invite
Add with:  Invitation, {Train} (when target is Critical), {Dragon Tame}
Block with:  Cursed Ring, Barette, Ribbon, add Invite
Duration:  infinite

[Reflect]
Appearance:  none
Description:  Reflectable spells bounce off a character with the 'Reflect'
condition and are redirected to another panel.  The new target panel of 
the spell will at the end of a line segment drawn between caster and 
target, where the target is the midpoint.  This is much easier to explain
with a diagram:

_|_|_|_|_|_|_
_|_|_|_|_|_|_    c = caster
_|_|_|_|_|r|_    t = target
_|_|_|t|_|_|_    r = new target panel for reflected spell
_|c|_|_|_|_|_
_|_|_|_|_|_|_

Add with:  Reflect, Carbunkle, Lick, Reflect Mail (A), Reflect Ring (A), 
           Cherche (A)
Cancel with:  Dispel Magic, Despair, Despair 2, Odd Soundwave
Duration:  32 clockticks

[Quick]
Appearance:  n/a
Description:  If the Quicked character is eligible (i.e., he has no 
status ailments that would prevent him from taking a turn), that 
character gets a quick-turn.  Quick is cancelled upon the beginning 
of this AT.  (If a Stopped character is Quicked, he will remain at CT
100 until after Stop wears off).  Quick-turns take precedence over all
other turns; they are placed at the top of the AT_list regardless of
the character's position on the character_list (see A.2).  See A.4
for a detailed discussion of the Quick status.
Add with:  Quick, {Dragon LevelUp}, Last Song, Critical Quick (R)

[6.1] crystals
      =========================================================================

When an enemy crystallizes and you are given the opportunity to learn its 
abilities, you will gain ALL of the abilities on the list, not just the one 
you select. 

Each ability has a characteristic chance of appearing on the list that
is generated when a unit picks up a crystal.  In order for the crystal-
picking unit to learn a given ability, these conditions must be met:

(1) The unit that left the crystal must have had the ability learned;
(2) The unit that picks up the crystal must have access to the EXACT job
    from which the dead unit learned the ability. For instance, a
    (34)-Holy Knight (Agrias' class) cannot learn Lightning Stab from 
    a dead (05)-Holy Knight (Delita's class).
    
Note that only humans can transfer abilities via crystal -- monsters
always have access to their full complement of abilities anyway, so it
would be kind of pointless.

Here are these crystallization probabilities for all the game's 
abilities.

ABILITY        CHANCE |  ABILITY        CHANCE |  ABILITY       CHANCE

For generic humans, the color of the crystal is an indicator of the 
unit's palette:

Ramza's units (palette 00) ............ teal-gray crystal
Hokuten units (palette 01) ............ bright blue crystal
Nanten units (palette 02) ............. red crystal
Death Corps units (palette 03) ........ yellow crystal
Glabados Church units (palette 04) .... purplish-gray crystal

Special humans and humanoid monsters will always drop teal-gray crystals,
regardless of their palette byte (although the poof of smoke that 
accompanies crystal formation will be colored by the palette byte).

Standard monsters' crystal color is determined by the unit's 'tier' within
its species.

Tier 1 monsters (Chocobo, Goblin, etc.) ................ teal-gray crystal
Tier 2 monsters (Black Chocobo, Black Goblin, etc.) .... bright blue crystal
Tier 3 monsters (Red Chocobo, Gobbledeguck, etc.) ...... red crystal

[6.2] counter magic
      =========================================================================

The 'Counter Magic' reaction ability causes a character to
respond to a magical attack with the same magical attack, with the
caster of the original magic being the epicenter of the countered
magic's range.  Counter Magic is activated by the following spells:

- All Black Magic except Fire 4, Ice 4, and Bolt 4
- Holy, Dark Holy
- Yin-Yang Magic except Pray Faith and Doubt Faith
- Slow, Slow 2, Don't Move, Quick, Stop, Demi, Demi 2, Meteor
- Bio, Bio 2, Bio 3
- Melt, Tornado, Quake
- Attacks from the Blaze Gun, Glacier Gun, and Blast Gun

For a discussion of the Counter Magic-Quick phenomenon, see section A.3.

Counter Magic cannot counter Calculated spells, nor can it counter
spells which have already been Reflected.  Similarly, a spell cast by
Counter Magic cannot be Reflected.

[6.3] experience, job points, and job levels
      =========================================================================
      
EXPERIENCE
----------

The Exp that a unit will gain when performing an action is given
by the following equation.

Exp = [Max{(10 + (T_Lv - C_Lv) + D), 1} * M]

     where T_Lv is the target's level
           C_Lv is the caster's (attacker's) level
           M = 2 if the caster has 'Gained Exp-UP'
               1 otherwise
           D is a 'death modifier' that only applies if the action
             kills its target. We define the variable PrevKills as the
             number of times the target has been killed previously in
             this battle, excluding the current kill. D is then determined
             as follows:
             
             If PrevKills = 0, then D = +10
             If PrevKills = 1, then D =   0
             If PrevKills = 2, then D =  -4
             If PrevKills = 3, then D =  -5
             If PrevKills = 4, then D =  -6
             If PrevKills = 5, then D =  -7
             If PrevKills > 5, then D =  -8
             
             (Thanks to Degenerator 12 <degenerator12@hotmail.com> for this
              information!)
           
     As an example of this, let's imagine a level 50 unit without Gained Exp-UP
     killing a level 53 unit repeatedly. It doesn't matter if the killing is 
     accomplished by adding Dead directly or by depleting the unit's HP.
     
     First kill:     PrevKills = 0, D = 10
                     Exp = (10 + (53 - 50) + 10) = 13 + 10 = 23
                  
     Second kill:    PrevKills = 1, D = 0
                     Exp = (10 + (53 - 50) + 0) = 13 + 0 = 13
                     
     Third kill:     PrevKills = 2, D = -1
                     Exp = (10 + (53 - 50) - 1) = 13 - 1 = 12
     .
     .
     .
                     
     Sixth kill:     PrevKills = 5, D = -8
                     Exp = (10 + (53 - 50) - 8) = 13 - 8 = 5
                     
     Seventh kill:   PrevKills = 6, D = -8
                     Exp = (10 + (53 - 50) - 8) = 13 - 8 = 5
     .
     .
     .
     
     And so on. As you can see, killing a unit nets you extra experiencne at
     first, but if you repeatedly kill the unit, you are penalized. The bonuses
     to Exp for consecutive kills of the same unit run as follows: +10, 0, -4,
     -5, -6, -7, -8, -8, -8, .... The -8 seems to go on ad infinitum. Remember,
     minimum Exp that an action can give is 1.
     
If the action has multiple (let's say N) targets, the caster will be awarded
Max{Exp.(1),Exp.(2), ... ,Exp.(N)}, where Exp.(X) refers to the experience 
awarded for executing the action on target X.


JOB POINTS
----------
     
JP are doled out according to this equation:

JP = [(8 + (JobLevel * 2) + [Lv / 4]) * M]

where JobLevel is caster's level at their current job 
           (can range from 1 - 8)
      Lv is the level of the person performing the action
      M is 3/2 if the caster has 'Gained JP-UP'
           1 otherwise

JP SHARING
When unit X gains JP, everyone else in the party will earn
[gained JP / 4] towards the job which unit X currently has.
Note: if unit X has 'Gained JP-UP', the extra JP given by that
ability are ignored in the JP sharing equation.

Monsters do not receive JP.


JOB LEVELS
----------

A unit's job level for each job is dependent only on the total JP 
the unit has gained in that job:

                Job Level 0:    0 to   99 total JP
                Job Level 1:  100 to  199 total JP
                Job Level 2:  200 to  349 total JP
                Job Level 3:  350 to  549 total JP
                Job Level 4:  550 to  799 total JP
                Job Level 5:  800 to 1149 total JP
                Job Level 6: 1150 to 1549 total JP
                Job Level 7: 1550 to 2099 total JP
                Job Level 8: 2100 or more total JP

When a unit first unlocks a job, it will automatically be at job
level 1, so the unit will receive (100..199) JP.

Job level is separate from the 'Mastered' designation, which appears
when a unit has learned all available abilities in a job. Any job that
requires < 2100 JP to master can be mastered on a lower level than 8.

[6.4] learning magic without jp
      =========================================================================

The spells Ultima and Zodiac must be learned 'blue mage style':  by 
experiencing their effects.  However, other spells can be learned 
in this manner as well.  In order for a unit to learn a spell blue mage
style, his or her current job MUST coincide with the spell's job of origin.
The learning unit must be a target of the spell, the spell must succeed on
the learning unit. Success is defined as dealing damage greater than zero
(for damaging attacks) or adding the intended status (for status-adding
attacks). If these conditions are met, the target will be given a chance
to learn the spell. This chance is equal to the chance that the ability
will be inherited from a dropped crystal (see section 6.1 for a table).

_______________________________________________________________________________
[6.5] weather and terrain
      =========================================================================

The weather and terrain on the battlefield can have a (limited)
influence on the battle mechanics.

Normally you can move a number of sqaures equal to your Move statistic,
so we might say that moving one square uses one 'Move Point'.

WATER
-----

When moving through flowing water, moving one square instead uses two Move
Points.  You cannot advance a square in flowing water unless you have
two Move Points left.  This means if you have a Move of 5, you will only
be able to move two squares in flowing water.  This effect is nullified if
the unit in question has the movement abilities 'Any Ground' or 
'Move Undrwater' equipped.

Stagnant water has no effect on Move under normal conditions.  However, if
it is raining heavily or thunderstorming, stagnant water (as in marshes 
and small ponds) also requires two Move Points to traverse one square.
This effect is nullified if the unit in question has the movement abilities
'Any Weather' or 'Move Undrwater' equipped.

When standing in water, you are considered to be at a height equal to the
stated height of the panel minus the depth of the water, unless you have
an ability that changes this such as 'Float' (which allows you to hover 1h
over the water) or 'Move in Water' (which allows you to walk on the water).

If a unit is submerged in water 2h deep or greater, the unit cannot Act
or use reaction abilities (including Abandon and Blade Grasp, which will
become disabled).  This effect is neutralized if the unit has the 'Float'
status or the movement abilities 'Move in Water' or 'Walk on Water'.


THUNDERSTORMS
-------------

In some battles, thunderstorms will be occurring.  If this is the 
case, then damage from Lightning-elemental spells = [normal_damage * 5/4] 
and damage from Fire-elemental spells = [normal_damage * 3/4].  This 
effect is also nullified if the caster has the 'Any Weather' ability.


SNOWSTORMS
----------

In the case of a snowstorm during battle, damage from Ice-elemental
spells = [normal_damage * 5/4].  This, too, is nullified if the caster
has 'Any Weather'.


SLOPED PANELS
-------------

When moving onto a panel over a height difference, the overall height of
the panel is irrelevant; what is relevant is the height of the edge that
borders the panel you are moving to.  To illustrate:

                 
       (B) - stated height = '7'         
      |\         8   Assume each panel is two characters wide, and 1h =
      | \        7   1 character high.  A unit standing on C (3h)
      |  |       6   with a Jump of 3 can make it onto panel (B), even
      |  |       5   though the stated height is 7, because the closer
   (A)|  |(C)    4   edge is of height 6.  Similarly, a unit standing
 --|--    --|--| 3   on (A) with a Jump of 4 _cannot_ make it onto panel
                     (B), even though the stated height is 7, because
                     the closer edge is at height 8.


HORIZONTAL JUMPING
------------------

A unit is able to jump over a horizontal gap of length [Jump / 2] panels,
where 'Jump' is the unit's Jump statistic.  Jump +1, Jump +2, and Jump +3
increase your ability to Jump horizontally, as they affect your Jump
statistic directly, but Ignore Height does not, as it only permits
infinite vertical jumping.


FALLING
-------

If a character falls (because of the knocking back effect of Throw 
Stone, a critical hit, or a similar attack) a distance greater than
his Jump statistic, he will sustain damage:

fall_damage = RU{((fall_distance - Jump) * MaxHP) / 10}


STEEL NEEDLE TRAPS
------------------

Steel Needle traps deal damage equal to [MaxHP / 5].


DEGENERATOR TRAPS
-----------------

Degenerator traps cause you to lose 1 level, and lose the stat growth
that you would have gained during that level up had it occured in your
current job.  If you step on one at level 1, you will remain at level 1,
but your stats will still undergo a decrease according to the level down
formula found in section 7.3.


A SHOT IN THE DARK
------------------

When the battle takes place at night, there is an accuracy 
penalty charged to users of bows and crossbows.  A target's
evade percentages (P.CEv, P.SEv, P.AEv) are increased as follows:

                    night_evade = RU{evade * 4/3}

Note that this doesn't apply for guns.


_______________________________________________________________________________
[6.6] blade grasp
      =========================================================================

The Samurai's 'Blade Grasp' is a powerful little reaction ability
which has the effect of adding an additional evade multiplier of
(1 - (Br/100)) to the success% of the attack in question.  Blade
Grasp is not the same as evasion, however -- several attacks which
can be evaded cannot be blocked by Blade Grasp, and a few that can
be blocked by Blade Grasp cannot be evaded by other means.  Blade
Grasp works on the same attacks that Counter does (see the list in
section 3.3), with the exception that Blade Grasp works against Spell Guns,
while Counter does not.

Note that in the case of a Two Swords attack, Blade Grasp can only block
one of the two hits -- if the first hit is Grasped, the second can't be (but
if the first hit connects, the second can be Grasped). 

Blade Grasp does not activate in response to blows from the Counter, 
Hamedo or Meatbone Slash reaction abilities.


_______________________________________________________________________________
[6.7] teleport
      =========================================================================

(thanks to Goryus on the GameFAQs FFT Message Board for this data)

The 'Teleport' ability from the Time Mage is one of the game's best,
allowing a unit to ignore height differences and pass through walls
and obstacles.  Teleport can fail if you attempt to teleport too far,
however, and the success rate is given by the formula below.

success% = min(100, (100 - 10 * (teleport_distance - move)))

where 'teleport_distance' is the number of squares that you are
teleporting -- note that just as with normal movement, each square 
you move diagonally counts as two squares, because you can only move 
in four directions (forward, backward, left and right).

'Move' is the Move stat of the person who is teleporting.

This equation essentially means that you are penalized 10% for each
square outside your movement range that you attempt to teleport.  If
you teleport inside your movement range, you are guaranteed success.


_______________________________________________________________________________
[6.8] random events
      =========================================================================

(thanks to Goryus for the data in this section)

There are a few attacks in FFT that have an additional effect sometimes
when they are used.  These include the Holy Sword attacks, weapons with
'Add:', and the Dash and Throw Stone abilities.  Here is a list of
random occurrences along with their probabilities of happening.

EVENT            PROB.  DESCRIPTION / EXAMPLES
--------------   -----  -----------------------------------------------
Weapon's magic    25%   random spellcasting from weapons like the Ice 
                        Brand, Fire Rod, Holy Lance, and Lightning Bow
Spell quote       15%   long spell quote vs. only the name of the spell
Critical hit       5%   a physical attack that causes more damage.
                        it will make a different sound and the damage
                        numbers will appear in a different way than
                        usual.  See section 2.1 for details.
Katana breakage   15%   when using DRAW OUTs
Knockback         50%   targets of certain attacks will be knocked 
                        back one square (assuming there is an empty square 
                        in back of where the target is standing) fifty 
                        percent of the time.  The following attacks
                        can trigger this: (Critical hit), Dash, Throw Stone,
                        Cat Kick, Tail Swing.
Undead revival    50%   a unit with 'Undead' status will be revived
                        with a random number of HP from 1 to (MaxHP)
                        instead of crystallizing when the Dead
                        counter reaches -1.


_______________________________________________________________________________
[6.9] longbow range modifications
      =========================================================================

Normally, longbows can fire between three and five squares away from the 
Archer.  However, height differences modify this range. Call this height 
difference 'HD':

          HD = (shooter's height - target's height)

                 bow range = 5 + [HD / 2]

This means that you get a +1 range extension for each 2h in vertical height 
if you are higher, and a -1 range penalty for every 2h in vertical height if 
you are lower.

Crossbows and guns are not subject to this range modification.


_______________________________________________________________________________
[6.10] on brave and faith
       ========================================================================

When the game generates new units, it randomly assigns Brave and Faith values,
with the exception of a few story battle enemies (bosses and the Wizards at
Bethla Sluice, for example) that have fixed Faith. The range of Brave and 
Faith values depends on where the unit is generated:

UNIT IS GENERATED   RANGE OF BR & FA
-----------------   ----------------
At start of game    (45..74)
As random enemy     (45..74)
In soldier office   (40..70)
From monster egg    (40..70)

Unlike most other stats, you can permanently change Brave and Faith
during a battle.  The formula by which the permanent Brave or Faith
gain is determined is

permanent_BraveGain = [battle_BraveGain / 4]
permanent_FaithGain = [battle_FaithGain / 4]

where battle_BraveGain = (Brave at end of battle - Brave at start of battle)
      battle_FaithGain = (Faith at end of battle - Brave at start of battle)

To write the equation in plain English: for ever four points of Brave or Faith 
you gain (lose) in battle, you will gain (lose) one permanently.

Furthermore, if your Brave gets too low, or your Faith too high, bad things
will happen.

If his or her Faith is greater than or equal to 95 at the end of a battle, any 
character except for Ramza or a Guest will immediately leave the party out of 
religious fervor, never to be heard from again (maybe they join the 
Glabadosian Right?).

If the unit's Faith is 85 to 94, you'll sometimes receive 'Warnings' at
the end of battle warning you how your bloodthirsty ways are unholy.

If the unit's Brave is 5 or lower at the end of a battle, the unit will 
immediately leave the party due to cowardice.

If the unit's Brave is 6 to 15, you'll sometimes get a cowardly 'Warning' 
at the end of the battle.

The above apply to in-battle Brave and Faith values, not permanent Brave
and Faith values.


_______________________________________________________________________________
[6.11] enemy levels
       ========================================================================

Levels of enemy units in FFT can be determined by three different schemes. 

FIXED LEVEL:  This is used for most enemies in story battles. The enemy's 
level is fixed at a certain value and will always be the same, regardless of
the levels of your party members. For instance, Velius is always at Level 31.


VARIABLE RANDOM:  This is used for most enemies in random battles. The enemy's
level is randomly chosen based on the highest-levelled member of your party.
This counts all units on your 16-man roster, regardless of whether you 
actually bring them into battle. If we call the level of this highest-levelled
unit 'HiLv':
                   enemy level = ((HiLv - [HiLv/8]) .. HiLv)


VARIABLE NONRANDOM:  This scheme is used for certain enemies in random 
battles and is especially prevalent in the Deep Dungeon. If we use the same
definition of HiLv as above:
                            enemy level = HiLv + K
       where K is some constant (in practice, it ranges from 0 to ~24)
 
In all cases, the maximum level that can be generated is 99.


_______________________________________________________________________________
[6.12] missing and guarding
       ========================================================================

When attacks fail to connect, there are a few different messages that can be
displayed.

'Missed!' is displayed under the following conditions:
    (1) The attack misses due to inherent inaccuracy (most status-inducing
        attacks, STEAL and BATTLE SKILL commands don't have a 100% success
        rate, even independent of evasion).
    (2) The target evades the attack through its CEv (class evasion).
    (3) The target dodges the attack through Arrow Guard.
    (4) The attack carries an elemental that the target is directly 
        immune to.
    (5) The target is not a valid target for the attack, but the attack
        would have been beneficial to the unit had it succeeded (e.g., 
        casting Dragon Care on a target that is not a Dragon or Hydra, or
        casting Esuna on a target with no status ailments).

'Guarded' is displayed under the following conditions:
    (1) The target has inherent, equipment-mediated, or status-mediated 
        immunity to the effect of the attack (e.g., trying to target Stop 
        on a unit with the Black Costume, trying to use status effects 
        on a Zodiac beast with inherent immunity, or trying to Invite a 
        unit that has already been Invited).
    (2) The target evades the attack through its SEv (shield evasion).
        In this case, an image of the target's shield will also appear.
    (3) The target evades the attack through its WEv (weapon evasion)
        in conjunction with Weapon Guard. In this case, an image of the
        target's weapon will also appear.
    (3) The target evades the attack through its AEv (mantle evasion).
    (4) The target dodges the attack through Blade Grasp or Finger Guard. 
        In this case, the target will also raise both arms.
    (5) The attack is Earth-elemental and the target is floating.
    (6) The target is not a valid target for the attack, but the 
        attack would have been harmful to the target had it succeeded
        (e.g., casting Seal Evil on a non-Undead unit or casting a
        MIGHTY SWORD attack on a unit lacking the proper piece of 
        equipment).
        
'Caught' is displayed if a unit intercepts a THROW attack using the
Catch reaction ability.
 
Attacks on Dead units (other than those that cancel: Dead) will not even
graphically resolve, nor will attacks targeted on units of the wrong team
(Allure on an ally, for example).

[7.1] how stats work in fft    
      =========================================================================

The five surface stats of each unit -- HP, MP, Speed, PA, and MA -- are
determined from a set of five more 'raw stats' that are then multiplied
by job-dependent constants. The raw stats are never visible in-game, 
but they are stored in the game's memory.

The stats you actually see are derived from these hidden parameters by 
these equations:

                HP = [(RawHP * ClassHPMultiplier) / 1638400]
                MP = [(RawMP * ClassMPMultiplier) / 1638400]
                Sp = [(RawSp * ClassSpMultiplier) / 1638400]
                PA = [(RawPA * ClassPAMultiplier) / 1638400]
                MA = [(RawMA * ClassMAMultiplier) / 1683400]

Notes:

- If the final value is less than 1, it becomes 1 -- that is,
  revised_value = max{value, 1}.

- Enemy Zodiac beasts, in the special story battles where you fight them, 
  have unique equations that determine their HP and MP:

                HP = [(RawHP * ClassHPMultiplier) / 163840] 
                MP = [(RawMP * ClassMPMultiplier) / 163840]

  The division by 163,840 instead of by 1,638,400 accounts for the Zodiac 
  beasts' extremely high HP and MP despite their unremarkable multipliers.

The following subsections discuss the different components of the stat 
determination formula.


RAW STATS
---------

> RHP, RMP, RPA, RMA, and RSp (Raw HP, Raw MP, Raw PA, Raw MA, Raw Speed) 
  are three-byte values (values between 0 and $FFFFFF, or 16777215). They 
  are stored at the following locations in the RAM (this is unimportant 
  unless you have a GameShark or other means of modifying the RAM):

  GAMESHARK ASIDE: feel free to ignore
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The raw stats are stored at the following RAM locations (presented in 
  GameShark code format):

                    STAT  BYTE 3     BYTE 2     BYTE 1
                    ----  ---------- ---------- ----------
                    RHP   3005xx8F   3005xx8E   3005xx8D
                    RMP   3005xx92   3005xx91   3005xx90
                    RSp   3005xx95   3005xx94   3005xx93
                    RPA   3005xx98   3005xx97   3005xx96
                    RMA   3005xx9B   3005xx9A   3005xx99

           (xx defines which character you're modifying, as with
            the job and sprite GameShark codes... $7F = unit 01,
            $80 = unit 02, $81 = unit 03, etc.)
  
  If byte 3 were $08, byte 2 were $3E, and byte 1 were $99, the raw stat
  would have the value $083E99, or 540313. Note that the bytes are IN REVERSE 
  ORDER in terms of their RAM locations -- that is, because most hex editors
  display addresses increasing from left to right, byte 1 comes first in the 
  RAM, followed by byte 2, followed by byte 3, whereas in the value of the 
  actual raw stats, byte 3 is worth most, followed by byte 2, followed by 
  byte 1.

  END GAMESHARK ASIDE  

  How do you determine the values of your units' raw stats? What follows 
  is a list of the initial raw stat values (i.e., at level 1) for different
  kinds of units.

  For human units, the initial value is a constant for a each gender for the 
  RSp, RPA, and RMA stats.  For monsters, which are all one gender and are 
  neither male nor female, only RSp is nonrandom.

                                     initial values
                         Gender   RSp     RPA     RMA
                         -------  ------  ------  ------
                         Male     98,304  81,920  65,536
                         Female   98,304  65,536  81,920
                         Monster  81,920  random  random

  Because the level up bonus is ultimately based on this initial value, 
  females will have better MA growth than males, and males will have better 
  PA growth than females.

  EXCEPTION:  Ramza starts with 81,920 of both RPA and RMA (but otherwise
  is a normal male, despite his appearance). 
  
  Monsters have randomized initial RPA and RMA values.  A monster's initial
  values will lie between the two extrema for each stat, inclusive.
                      
                  Gender    initial RPA        initial RMA 
                  -------   ----------------   ----------------
                  Monster   (81,920..98,303)   (81,920..98,303)

  However, RHP and RMP have random variation for all units, human and 
  monster; different units will start with different amounts of RHP and RMP 
  within a certain range:

                 Gender    initial RHP          initial RMP
                 -------   ------------------   ------------------
                 Male      (491,520..524,287)   (229,376..245,759)
                 Female    (458,752..491,519)   (245,760..262,143)
                 Monster   (573,440..622,591)   (98,304..147,455)

  Note that bred monsters, instead of having truly random stats, seem to 
  have their raw stats all selected at once from a set of 250-500 preset 
  'stat configurations'.  Bred monsters can have Brave and Faith ranging 
  from 40 to 70 inclusive, unlike other randomly-generated monsters and 
  units found in battle, which can have Brave and Faith ranging from 45 
  to 74 inclusive.


MULTIPLIERS
-----------

> Multipliers are class-specific constants that mostly fall between 50 and 
  200. Differences in multipliers are chiefly responsible for the strengths 
  and weaknesses of FFT's jobs -- a Lancer, for instance, has a very high PA
  mulitplier (PAM) but a very low MA multiplier (MAM). Different classes 
  also have different rates of stat growth (see section 7.2 below), but 
  differences in multipliers turn out to be more significant for the surface 
  stats.
  
  For practice working with raw stats and multipliers, let's calculate the
  range of the surface stats HP and MP that you'll see on the Level 1 Squires
  you can recruit from the Soldier Office.
  
  Looking at section 7.4, we can see that a generic Squire (class 4A) has
  an HP multiplier (HPM) of 100 and an MP multiplier (MPM) of 75. Let's 
  consider a female Squire. Females start with between 458,752 and 491,519
  RHP (from the chart above). Plugging these values into the equation
  at the beginning of this section, we get:
  
  Minimum female HP = [(RHP * HPM) / 1638400] = [(458752 * 100) / 1638400]
                    = [45875200 / 1638400] = 28
                    
  Maximum female HP = [(RHP * HPM) / 1638400] = [(491519 * 100) / 1638400]
                    = [49151900 / 1638400] = 29
                    
  So females should start with either 28 or 29 HP, excluding bonuses from
  equipment (which will just be added onto the 28 or 29).
  
  For RMP, initial values range between 245,760 and 262,143, and Squire's
  MPM is 75. So:
  
  Miminum female MP = [(RMP * MPM) / 1638400] = [(245760 * 75) / 1638400]
                    = [18432000 / 1638400] = 11
  Maximum female MP = [(RMP * MPM) / 1638400] = [(262143 * 75) / 1638400]
                    = [19660725 / 1638400] = 11
                    
  Females should always start with 11 MP on level 1. But note that although
  all females have 11 MP at level 1, their raw MP values are randomly 
  generated, and this difference will become evident at higher levels.
  
  Bonuses from equipment are added on top of these values. In the 
  Soldier Office, all recruits come equipped with Clothes (HP +5, MP +0) 
  and Leather Hat (HP +8, MP +0), for a total equipment bonus of HP +13,
  MP +0. So all female recruits you find in the Office should have 41 or 42
  HP and 11 MP. Try it out -- it works!

There are some consequences of the initial raw stat distribution:
  - females gain more MP and MA on level up than males
  - males gain more HP and PA on level up than females
  - monsters gain more HP, PA, and MA than either human sex;
    monsters gain less MP and Speed than either human sex (though the 
    Speed stat often rivals or exceeds humans because monster classes 
    tend to have lower C values for Speed than do human classes).
   

_______________________________________________________________________________
[7.2] leveling up
      =========================================================================

Okay, so now we know how raw stats work on level 1, but how do stats change
when units level up?

RHP, RMP, RSp, RPA, and RMA are all increased on level up, even when there
is no visible increase in the corresponding surface stat. Different classes
get different raw stat bonuses on level up, which results in the classes' 
differing stat growth. The difference in stat growth between genders is only
because of the differences in the initial statpoint distribution -- if you
use GameShark to give a female 105,000 RPA at level 1, she will have better
PA growth than a male.

Raw stat growth on leveling up is determined by the following equation:

                        bonus = [current_RX / (C + Lv)]

   where RX is a generic term for any raw stat (RHP, RMP, RSp, RPA, or RMA)
         Lv is the LOWER level in question -- so if you are leveling up
            from 50 to 51, Lv = 50.  
   
C is a constant that varies for each class. The value of C is what 
differentiates one class's growth pattern from another's. Keep in mind 
that since C is in the denominator of this expression, LOWER VALUES OF C 
YIELD HIGHER STATS. 

> Note that if you don't do any leveling down (see section 7.3 for the 
  effect of leveling down) and never change jobs, it just so happens that 
  the amount of raw stats you gain on a level up will be a constant. That 
  is, the ratio of current_RX to (C + Lv) remains constant -- meaning if 
  you want to calculate the raw stat increase from multiple level ups, 
  you just have to calculate it once and multiply it by the number of 
  level ups. Not too useful for humans, but very useful for monsters,
  who can't change jobs.


_______________________________________________________________________________
[7.3] leveling down     
      =========================================================================

For years, FFT players have been using the 'level up/down' trick to build 
characters with super stats.  The idea behind the trick is that you level up 
in a job with strong stat growth (low C values) such as Ninja or Mime, and 
then level down (using Mindflare's 'Level Blast' technique or one of the 
many Degenerator traps scattered throughout the game's battlefields) with a 
class with poor stat growth (high C values) such as Bard or Dancer.  Though 
the game adjusts your stats when you level down so that you lose the stats 
that you would have gained as that class, by using poor classes to level down 
you can fool the game and lose less going down than you gain going up; in
this manner, you can build all your stats up to their maxima if you do enough 
leveling cycles.

Note though, that if you level up and down _without_ changing classes, you 
will actually _lower_ your stats.  This is because the level down algorithm 
is the following equation:

                     decrement = [current_RX / (Lv + C)]
   
     where Lv is the level you are levelling DOWN to (i.e., the lower
           level).  For instance, if you level down to 50 from level 51, 
           Lv = 50.

This results in a slight stat decrease.  Consider the following example.

Suppose you have a male Squire (491,520 < initial RHP < 524,288) with initial
RHP of 504,000.  Levelling up from 1 to 2, he will receive an RHP bonus as 
follows (HPC = 11):

bonus = [504,000 / (11 + 1)] = [504,000 / 12] = 42000.

Your new RHP at level 2 will be 546,000.  So if you level down from 2 to 1, 
your RHP will decrease as follows:

decrement = [546,000 / (11 + 1)] = [546,000 / 12] = 45500.

Your new RHP at level 1 will then be 546,000 - 45500 = 500,500 instead of 
504,000 as you had originally.

While this isn't that big of a decrease, if done all the way down from level 
99 to level 1, it can add up.  However, if you do change classes while 
leveling down, this small loss will be compensated for by the higher C 
values of the poor stat-gaining class that you level down in.

[7.4] the class compendium
      =========================================================================

This section gives detailed information on all the jobs and classes in FFT.
Many of these are normally enemy-only, but they can be easily accessed with
a GS (and even if you don't have a GS, you can see what you're up against).

ABBREVIATIONS USED IN THE CLASS COMPENDIUM:

COMMAND SET:  The primary command set innately associated with this class.
              You can look up the command set in Appendix C by searching for
              its name within [SQUARE BRACKETS].
              
SPRITE:       The sprite associated with this class. This is the sprite that
              will result if you input the class' hex index number into the
              GameShark code 3005xx74 00??. If a '(+)' follows the sprite 
              name, then the sprite will be glitchless on the formation 
              screen. If nothing follows the sprite name, the sprite will
              be usable in battle but appear glitched on the formation 
              screen. If a '(-)' follows the sprite name, the sprite is
              either glitched in battle or missing normal frames of 
              animation.

EQ:           List of equippable items. The category 'Accessory' includes 
              Shoes, Gauntlets, Rings, Armlets, and Mantles. In addition to 
              the equips listed, all females can equip Ribbons, Bags, and 
              Perfumes in any equipment-using class. 

IMMUNE:       List of status changes and elements that the class is innately
              immune to. Note that battle-specific immunites can be set over
              innate immunities, so that classes used as enemies are often
              immune to more status ailments than will be listed in this 
              guide (for example, Serpentarius is not innately immune to 
              Frog, but Elidibs has Frog immunity set for the battle when
              you fight him).
              
INNATE:       List of innate abilties, including reaction abilities, support
              abilities, movement abilities, elemental absorption, elemental
              halving, and elemental weakness.
              
HPM:          HP multiplier
HPC:          C value for raw HP increment on level up
MPM:          MP multiplier
MPC:          C value for raw MP increment on level up
SpM:          Speed multiplier
SpC:          C value for raw speed increment on level up
PAM:          PA multiplier
PAC:          C value for raw PA increment on level up
MAM:          MA multiplier
MAC:          C value for raw MA increment on level up

TYPE:         The type of unit that this class is intended for:
              Special - Special human class. Can use equipment, change jobs,
                        and customize abilities. If a unit has one of these 
                        classes as a base class, its sprite will not change
                        when it changes jobs.
              Generic - Generic human class. Can use equipment, change jobs,
                        and customize abilities. Base class is 80 (for males) 
                        or 81 (for females). No base sprite; sprite changes 
                        with job change.
              Monster - Monster class. Cannot change jobs, use equipment or 
                        customize abilities. Base class is 82. No base sprite; 
                        sprite is determined by the specific monster class. 
              Demon -   Monster class. Cannot change jobs, use equipment or
                        customize abilities. Base class is 82. No base sprite;
                        sprite is determined by the specific demon class.
                        Although demon class units cannot set abilities
                        in-game, reactions, supports, and movements can be set 
                        (and will work) using a GameShark. (Steel Giant works 
                        the same as demon classes, and so is classified as a 
                        demon.)
              Lucavi -  Same as demon, except that the base class determines
                        the sprite. Lucavi units are sometimes male gender and 
                        sometimes monster gender. (Holy Dragon works the same
                        as Lucavi classes, and so is classified as a Lucavi.)

              is dependent on another code:
              
              3005xx78 00?0    Determines unit's gender:
                               8 = male
                               4 = female

[A.1] action and reaction
      =========================================================================

Before considering FFT's gameflow, it is important to understand
the three following terms:

- A SLOW ACTION is any attack which requires a charging time between
  the time it is selected and the time when it is actually executed.
  Each slow action has an associated value known as 'ctr' (clockticks
  till resolution) which specifies this duration in clockticks.  Slow
  actions can only resolve during SR phases. 

- A FAST ACTION is any attack which is resolved immediately upon 
  selection.  Fast actions resolve during CR phases; slow actions
  can never resolve in a CR phase.

- A REACTION is any counterattack or ability immediately executed by
  the target of a just-resolved slow action, fast action, or act of
  mimicry.  Reaction abilities cannot be reacted to or mimed.  The
  nature of the reaction is determined by a unit's reaction ability.
  An altered version of Newton's third law governs reaction abilities
  in FFT: every action has a _chance_ to generate a reaction; however,
  as mentioned above, reactions do not count as actions themselves.

Simple, huh?  Now, for the good stuff...


_______________________________________________________________________________
[A.2] basic gameflow
      =========================================================================

* NOTE: The theories in this section were originally devised by Aaditya
  Rangan -- I've just revised them, working out some of the kinks.


THE UNIT-LIST
-------------

At the beginning of each battle, enemy and ally characters are
assigned numbers in a unit-list, as follows.

(1) Each enemy (red) formation comes with pre-selected enemy 
index numbers. These units are numbered first in the unit-list, 
starting at 01. 

(2) The numbers of the player (blue) units are determined by the 
player's placement of the units on the map before battle, in this 
order: 
                 ________________ 
                /_L_/_K_/_J_/_I_/      
               /_H_/_G_/_F_/_E_/        
              /_D_/_C_/_B_/_A_/          

(the actual perspective seen in the game is this drawing rotated
 roughly 30 degrees clockwise)

The three 'rows' are ABCD, EFGH, and IJKL.  Sometimes a map will
have more rows than this, but you should be able to deduce the
pattern for any map from this drawing.

Squares are alphabetized (well, not really, but it makes it 
easier to visualize) in rows, the foremost row being considered first 
and the rearmost being considered last. Letter 'A' is assigned to the 
rightmost square in the foremost row. Blue units are then numbered 
sequentially on the unit-list, starting from 17, based on the 
squares they are standing on in alphabetical order. 

In the case of multiple units with CT >= 100, the one with the
lowest number on the unit-list gets to go first. Since each unit
has a unique number, this resolves all ties.


PHASES OF BATTLE
----------------

Once the unit-list is formed, gameflow proceeds as follows:

<do> 
Status Check
S+ phase
SR phase, if required
C+ phase
CR phase, if required
<loop> 

This applies to ordinary battle situations -- i.e., 
no miming, critical quicking, counter-magic quick loops or the like.  
See sections A.3 and A.4 for that type of stuff. :)


STATUS CHECK PHASE
------------------

One 'clocktick' is defined as the duration of time between two
consecutive status check phases.

During the status check phase, each active time-dependent status 
effect has its clocktick countdown decreased by 1.

The unit-list is checked in order, and all status effects whose
clocktick countdowns have reached zero are removed.

The initial clocktick countdown values of timed status effects
are listed here:

               LENGTH OF
STATUS         COUNTDOWN  
-------------- -------------
Charm ........ 32 clockticks      NOTE: when compared to the
Don't Act .... 24 clockticks            values in previous versions
Don't Move ... 24 clockticks            of the guide, these durations
Faith ........ 32 clockticks            are 1 clocktick longer, because
Haste ........ 32 clockticks            the status is now considered
Innocent ..... 32 clockticks            to expire, for instance, at
Poison ....... 36 clockticks            the beginning of the 32nd
Protect ...... 32 clockticks            clocktick instead of at the
Reflect ...... 32 clockticks            end of the 31st.
Regen ........ 36 clockticks
Shell ........ 32 clockticks
Slow ......... 24 clockticks
Sleep ........ 60 clockticks
Stop ......... 20 clockticks


S+ PHASE: SLOW-ACTION CHARGING
------------------------------

During this phase, every eligible slow-action has its CTR decremented
by 1 (see below).

Every slow-action has some initial CTR (this is the number given as
'CTR' in section 3.3) that counts down during the S+ phase. If two
slow-actions reach zero at the same time, the slow-action spawned by
the character with the lower number on the unit-list is resolved first.

Initial CTR values are listed for all slow-action in Parts 2 and 3 of
this guide. Here is another reference table comparing initial CTR values
for CHARGE, JUMP, and slow actions that are given a 'Speed' designation
by the game:

        
ACTION                INITIAL CTR
------                -----------       
Charge +1 ............ 4 
Charge +2 ............ 5 
Charge +3 ............ 6 
Charge +4 ............ 8 
Charge +5 ........... 10 
Charge +7 ........... 14 
Charge +10........... 20 
Charge +20........... 35 
JUMP ................ [50 / (jumper's speed)] 
5 SP actions ........ 20 
7 SP actions ........ 15 
10 SP actions ....... 10 
12 SP actions ....... 9 
13 SP actions ....... 8 
15 SP actions ....... 7 
17 SP actions ....... 6 
20 SP actions ....... 5 
25 SP actions ....... 4 
34 SP actions ....... 3 
50 SP actions ....... 2 

'SP' refers to the Speed stat that is listed for the attack in
the game. Notice that SP will only take on the values 5, 7, 10, 
12, 13, 15, 17, 20, 25, 34, and 50. This is because it doesn't 
really exist per se: rather, it's just an encoded form of the 
intitial value of CTR: SP = RU{100 / CTR}. 

All slow-actions, EXCEPT THOSE ON THE LIST THAT FOLLOWS, have their
initial ctr affected by Short Charge: 

                   short_CTR = RU{initial_CTR / 2}. 

List of actions not affected by Short Charge: 
- JUMP command 
- CHARGE commands 
- SING commands 
- DANCE commands 

Slow-actions whose CTRs are altered by Short Charge can also be 
made into fast-actions by the Non-charge ability. In that case, 
they are treated *as* fast-actions and not as slow-actions. 
   
All active CTR countdowns are decremented by 1 in the S+ phase, but 
nothing else can happen. Character's don't gain CT, nobody gets 
any turns, and spells don't go off.

At the end of S+ phase, if any CTR countdown has reached zero, the
game will flow into SR phase. Otherwise, it will skip directly to 
C+ phase.


SR PHASE: SLOW-ACTION RESOLUTION
--------------------------------
 
During this phase, slow-actions can resolve. Any pending slow-action
whose CTR countdowns has reached zero AND whose caster is healthy is
executed. Slow-actions that aren't fully charged are simply ignored.
If no slow-action countdowns have reached zero this clocktick, the
SR phase does not occur.

Slow-actions whose CTRs have reached zero can be resolved in the
following ways:

- If the caster does not have enough MP to pay for the attack, a
  'No MP' message will be displayed and the slow-action will be
  aborted.
- If the caster is Silenced and this an attack that is stopped by
  Silence, then a 'Silenced' message will be displayed and the slow-
  action will be aborted.
- If there are no units in the effect area of the attack, the slow-
  action will not graphically resolve (except for random-targeted
  attacks).
- Otherwise, the attack will graphically resolve.

When a slow-action resolves, each target, in unit-list order, is given a
chance to react (i.e., activate his or her reaction ability).

Units don't increment CT during this phase. Slow actions don't charge 
up during this phase. No characters can take any turns during this phase 
(with the exception of quick-turns, of course). 


C+ PHASE: CT CHARGING
---------------------

During this phase, units charge up their CT. Each unit adds to his 
or her CT appropriately:

                     CT increment = (unit's Speed)

Even if a unit's CT exceeds 100, the extra CT _will_ be stored (though 
not displayed on the CT bar).

No slow-actions charge up in this phase, and no slow actions are resolved. 
No units get any turns.

If at least one unit has CT >= 100 at the end of C+ phase, the game
will flow into CR phase. Otherwise, it will flow directly into the 
next Status Check phase and the clocktick will be over.


CR PHASE: ACTIVE TURN RESOLUTION
--------------------------------
 
During this phase, units can take their standard (non-quick) turns. That is,
units get their 'natural' ATs during this phase. During a unit's turn, he
or she can execute a fast-action or can start charging a slow-action. If 
multiple units have CT >= 100, the order is determined by the enumeration
in the unit-list; characters with lower numbers go first. Note that the
absolute value of CT is not used to break ties; all units with CT >= 100
are considered in unit-list order, regardless of what their specific CT
values are. If no units have CT >= 100 on this clocktick, CR phase does
not occur.

When a fast action resolves, each target, in unit-list order, is
given a chance to react. Reaction abilities are NOT considered fast
actions; they are 'faster than fast'.

Once a unit takes a turn, his CT is decreased as follows:

If unit moved and acted -->  new_CT = min{60, CT - 100}
If unit moved but did not act --> new_CT = min{60, CT - 80}
If unit acted but did not move --> new_CT = min{60, CT - 80}
If unit neither moved nor acted --> new_CT = min{60, CT - 60}

Note that if you have 'Don't Move' or 'Don't Act', for CT purposes
the game always considers that you have already moved or acted: i.e.,
a 'Don't Move' unit that waits or a 'Don't Act' unit that doesn't move
will still have his CT reduced by 80. If a unit has both 'Don't Move' 
and 'Don't Act', his CT will always be reduced by 100.

After the CR phase has concluded, all eligible units have taken their
turns and all fast-actions have been resolved and reacted to, the clocktick
is over and the game returns to the Status Check phase to begin the next
clocktick.


_______________________________________________________________________________
[A.3] the mime cycle
      =========================================================================

Whenever a fast-action or slow-action resolves and there are eligible Mimes
on the same team as its caster, a mime cycle ensues. During the mime cycle,
each Mime in battle will have a chance to mimic the last action that was taken
(call this the last_action). ONE last_action is stored in the game's memory,
along with who performed that last_action.  Reaction abilities are NOT written
into the last_action. If the Mime in question is not on the same team as the
person who performed the last_action, the last_action is NOT mimicked 
(this prevents mimicking enemy actions). Note that mimicked actions do NOT 
count as fast actions; they, like reaction abilities, are 'faster than fast'.  

Upon mimicking an action, the Mime's target(s) get a chance to 
react to the mimicry in order determined by the unit-list. Then the next Mime
on the unit-list mimics.  This goes on until no more eligible Mimes remain.

See section 2.8 for more details on Mimes.


_______________________________________________________________________________
[A.4] the quick and the dead
      =========================================================================

When a target is given the 'Quick' status, his CT is set to 100 (or sometimes 
154 for Critical Quick in response to a mimed spell -- probably a glitch) and
he or she receives a 'quick-flag'.  This quick-flag indicates that the unit is 
in line to receive a quick-turn. A quick-turn is distinguished from an active
turn (AT) in that it can occur during ANY phase of battle, not just the CR.
[The game will still display the 'AT' icon over a unit during a quick-turn, 
I'm making a distinction between 'quick turn' and 'active turn' (that is,
non-quick turn) to make discussion easier.]

What creates the difficulty are our friends, the Mimes, which can mimic the 
Quick spell and hand out quick-flags during the mime cycle!  And to boot, 
Quick can be Counter Magicked, which means a mimed Quick can be thrown back 
at the mime in the middle of the mime cycle, creating a really nasty 
gameflow mess.

Quick-flags can either be handed out (1) during an SR phase, (2) during a 
CR phase, or (3) during a quick-turn. Here are the different scenarios 
possible:

DURING AN SR PHASE:
- Quick spell or Last Song resolves and gives out quick-flags
- Quick spell is Counter Magicked, giving a quick-flag to the
  original caster of Quick
- A slow-action causes Critical Quick to trigger on one or
  more units, giving out quick-flags
- A mimed Quick spell or Last Song resolves
- A mimed Quick spell is Counter Magicked
- A mimed slow-action causes Critical Quick to trigger

DURING A CR PHASE OR QUICK-TURN:
- A unit casts Dragon LevelUp or Non-charge (NC) Quick spell 
  during his or her AT, giving a quick-flag to the target
- NC Quick is Counter Magicked, giving a quick-flag to
  the original caster of NC Quick
- A fast-action causes Critical Quick to trigger on one or 
  more units, giving out quick-flags
- A mimed NC Quick spell resolves
- A mimed NC Quick spell is Counter Magicked
- A mimed fast-action causes Critical Quick to trigger

The basic rule that allows you to resolve miming/quick-turn
dilemmas is this:
 
    -------------------------------------------------------------
   | During an SR PHASE, ONE quick-turn can happen between the   |
   | original action and the mime cycle. During a CR PHASE or    |
   | QUICK-TURN, NO quick-turns can happen in between the        |
   | original action and the mime cycle.                         |
    -------------------------------------------------------------

Here are the details for SR phase:

<SR PHASE BEGINS>
1. First slow-action resolves, potentially handing out quick-flags.
   [1-R] REACTIONS: Each target of (1) gets a chance to react. These 
         reactions can hand out quick-flags (Counter Magic or Critical Quick).
 [1-QT0] QUICK-TURN ZERO: All the units that received quick-flags in
         (1) and (1-R) are considered. The unit with the lowest number on
         the unit-list receives a quick-turn. If this unit performs a 
         fast-action, information on the last_action is rewritten, including
         who performed it. This means that if a fast-action performed during
         (1-QT0) differs from action (1), the mime cycle will be altered such
         that the action from (1-QT0) is mimed and action (1) is not. If the
         unit with the quick-turn starts charging a slow-action during (1-QT0),
         action (1) will still be mimicked during the mime cycle. Additionally,
         if a non-mimeable fast-action is performed during (1-QT0), or if the
         unit fast-acting during 1-QT0 is not on the same team as the caster
         of (1), the mime cycle will be aborted. (However, any Mimes on the
         team of the fast-acting unit will mimic that unit's action during
         1-M.) Any quick-flags handed out during (1-QT0) do not produce 
         quick-turns until after the mime cycle.
         
         =====================================================================
         ASIDE: SELF-QUICKING DURING QUICK-TURNS
         ---------------------------------------------------------------------
           Okay, so what happens if I use my quick-turn to add a quick-flag to
         myself with NC Quick? The answer is: it depends on whether you move
         or act first!
           Apparently, quick-flags are removed during quick-turns after a unit
         moves or waits, NOT after a unit acts. So let's envision two 
         scenarios:
           (a) MOVE FIRST. You have a quick-flag (call this QF+) and are
               taking your quick-turn. You move, and the quick-flag is 
               removed (now you're QF-). You cast NC Quick on yourself.
               Now you're QF+, and since you've already moved, you won't
               lose your QF! So assuming you're the lowest-numbered unit
               on the unit-list with a quick-flag, you'll get another
               quick-turn immediately after this one!
           (b) ACT FIRST. You're QF+, but now you choose to Act first.
               You cast NC Quick on yourself, which just means you're
               still QF+ (quick-flags don't stack: you either have one 
               or you don't). Now when you move or wait, you'll become
               QF- and your turn will end, so you'll LOSE the QF you
               just gave yourself and you won't get another quick-turn!
         =====================================================================
         
   [1-M] MIME CYCLE: After quick-turn zero comes the mime cycle. Each Mime on 
         the same team as the caster of (1) attempts to mimic (1), unless a 
         different fast-action was taken during (1-QT0) by a member of the 
         same team, in which case that fast-action is mimicked. If a 
         non-mimeable fast action was taken during (1-QT0), (1-M) is aborted.
         If the caster of a fast-action in (1-QT0) is on a different team from
         the caster of (1), then Mimes on the team that cast (1) will not get 
         a chance to mimic, but Mimes on the team that cast the action during
         (1-QT0) will get a chance to mimic. Quick-flags can be handed out
         during the mime cycle by Quick spells, Counter Magic, Last Song, or
         Critical Quick. NO QUICK-TURNS CAN HAPPEN DURING THE MIME CYCLE --
         the mime cycle runs to its completion, and then any remaining quick
         turns are resolved afterward. The order of mimicry is determined by
         the Mimes' numbers on the unit-list: lowest numbers go first.
 [1-QT1] FIRST STANDARD QUICK-TURN: After the mime cycle is done, all units
         with quick-flags will receive their quick-turns in unit-list order.
         It doesn't matter whether the unit received its quick-flag during
         the mime cycle or before the mime cycle -- the only determinant of
         quick-turn order is the unit-list. Fast-actions taken during 
         standard quick-turns can hand out quick-flags, cause reactions,
         and have their own mime cycles. Because no slow-actions can resolve
         during this subphase, all quick-flags handed out by fast-actions
         are deferred until after the mime sub-cycle.
         [QT1-M] FIRST MIME SUB-CYCLE: If a mimeable fast-action was taken
                 during (1-QT1), it is mimicked by all eligible Mimes on 
                 the team of the unit who performed the fast-action, 
                 in unit-list order. If any quick-flags are given out
                 during the mime sub-cycle, they are 'put on the pile'
                 with all the rest of the pending quick-flags and 
                 resolve in subsequent standard quick-turns.
 [1-QT2] SECOND STANDARD QUICK-TURN: Units with quick-flags are considered,
         and the one with the lowest number on the unit-list gets a 
         quick-turn. Again, it doesn't matter WHEN the quick-flags were
         added -- a unit that received a flag during QT1-M will go before
         a unit that received a flag way back during 1-R if he is numbered
         lower on the unit-list.
         [QT2-M] The second quick-turn will also span a mime cycle,
                 and so on until all quick-flags have been exhausted.
 .
 .   \   
 .    >- More standard quick-turns are executed until all quick-flags
 .   /   are exhausted.
 .
2. Second slow-action resolves ...
   [2-R] \
 [2-QT0]  \  
   [2-M],  > ... and the cycle repeats...
 [2-QT1]  /
  [etc.] /
... until all slow-actions have resolved, and
<SR PHASE ENDS>.


Now during CR phases:

The chief difference between resolution of quick-turns during SR and CR
phases is that ther is no QT0 during CR phases -- all quick-turns are
deferred until after the mime cycle is complete.

<CR PHASE BEGINS>
1. First active turn occurs. A unit can hand out quick-flags through the
   fast-actions NC Quick or Dragon LevelUp.
   [1-R] REACTIONS to the fast-action taken in (1) can also hand out
         quick-flags via Counter Magic or Critical Quick.
         In contrast to SR phases, all quick-flags handed out by (1) or 
         during (1-R) are deferred until after...
   [1-M] MIME CYCLE: works just as it did during SR phase. Continues all
         the way through, and all quick-flags handed out are deferred 
         until it is finished.
 [1-QT1] FIRST QUICK-TURN: All units with quick-flags are considered, and
         the unit with the lowest number on the unit-list gets a 
         quick-turn, no matter whether the flag was handed out by (1), 
         during (1-R) or during (1-M). Additional quick-flags can be handed
         out during (1-QT1).
         [QT1-M] MIME SUB-CYCLES can also happen during CR phase, and
                 they can hand out quick-flags.
 [1-QT2] As before, quick-turn order is determined only by unit-list
         order, even for units that just received a quick-flag during
         (1-QT1) or (QT1-M).
    .
    .    Quick-turns continue until all flags are exhausted...
    .
 2. Second active (non-quick) turn occurs, and the cycle continues until
<CR PHASE ENDS>

The above guidelines should cover any twisted scenario you can try to 
come up with involving Quick and Mimes.

                            &  A C C E S S O R I E S

This is a list of all the weapons, armor, and accessories in the game. Here's
a guide to the information you'll find:

NAME:    name of the item

##:      the game's internal reference number (in hex) for the item 
         (useful for GameShark codes and the like)

WP:      weapon power (for weapons)

Ev:      weapon evasion (for weapons)

HP+:     amount of HP this item will add when equipped (for armor)

MP+:     amount of MP this item will add when equipped (for armor)

PRICE:   price to buy the item in a standard shop, in gil. some items can
         only be bought from Fur Shops, in which case they'll be half of this
         cost. some items can't be bought at all (many of these have prices of
         10 gil)

E.LV:    random enemies will start using the item at this level. this means
         - randomly generated units will be able to equip it at this level
           and above
         - enemy units with THROW will be able to THROW it at this level and
           above
         - enemy units with DRAW OUT/SWORD SPIRIT will be able to use the
           corresponding DRAW OUT at this level and above
         if this number is enclosed in parentheses, this means that random
         enemies cannot equip the item. for instance, Defender has "(92)" here.
         this means that you'll never see a random enemy with a Defender
         equipped, although enemy Ninjas with 'Knight Sword' learned will be
         able to THROW it starting at level 92. non-random enemies (e.g.,
         Meliadoul, Dycedarg) also may equip this type of item.


TERMS USED IN ITEM DESCRIPTIONS
-------------------------------

"Add:" means that an ATTACK with the weapon will add the listed status effects 
to the target if it connects. This will only happen a certain amount of the
time (usually 25%).

"Auto-" before the name of a status effect means that this piece of equipment
automatically gives its wearer this status, and the status cannot be removed
unless the equipment is removed. If the equipment is removed, broken, or 
stolen, auto-status will immediately be removed. 

"Block:" means that the unit equipped with this item is protected from the
listed status effects and/or elements. In the case of status effects, any
attempt to add the status effect will be reduced to a 00% success rate. In 
the case of elements, any attack that causes damage carrying the listed 
elements will have a 00% success rate.

"Initial-" before the name of a status effect means that the wearer of this
piece of equipment will start each battle with that status effect. The effect
will not be added if you use 'Equip Change' to equip the item mid-battle, and
it will not be removed if the item is removed, stolen, or broken (unless 
something else that happens in the course of removing, stealing, or breaking
the item would have normally caused the status effect to disappear).

"M:" means that an ATTACK with the weapon will randomly cast the spell listed
after normal attack damage is dealt. This seems to happen 20-25% of the time.

'YES Two Swords' means that one of this type of weapon may be held in each hand
using the 'Two Swords' support ability.

'YES Two Hands' means that equipping the 'Two Hands' support ability will allow
you to grip this type of weapon in both hands, doubling damage.

'Both hands only' means that the weapon can only be held in both hands, and 
that 'Two Hands' has no effect on the weapon's damage.

This appendix lists the contents of all the command sets in the game,
including action, reaction, support, and movement abilities. The sets are 
listed in the order they are stored in the RAM. To find a command set in 
this list, search for its name in [square brackets]. Here is a sample 
listing with a legend:                                    
                                                    
xx [EXAMPLE SET]           ABBREVIATONS:            
------------------------   (A): Standard action ability. Can be used directly
Origin                JP        in battle.          
------------------------   (E): 'Enabling' ability. Learning this ability    
(A) Action Ability   500        enables the unit to take some action in
(E) Enable Ability   500        battle, but that action is not the same as
(G) Geomancy         500        the ability learned. Examples are MATH SKILL,
(R) Reaction         500        JUMP, THROW and CHARGE abilities. These 
(S) Support          500        abilities are useless outside their original
(M) Movement         500        command set.
........................   (G): Geomancy ability. Like a cross of (A) and (E),
JP to master:       3000        Geomancy abilities are treated specially when
                                in the ELEMENTAL command set, only being 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^        active on certain kinds of terrain. But they
xx is the two-digit hex         can be moved to other command sets via GS and
   reference number for         used directly.
   the command set,        (R): Reaction ability.
   used to access the      (S): Support ability.
   set with a GS.          (M): Movement ability.

                           Standard RSM: This listing means that the command
                           set contains the most common reaction, support, 
                           and movement abilities, these being
                           
                                Counter Tackle  180 JP

                                Monster Skill   200 JP
                                Defend           50 JP
                                Gained JP Up    200 JP
                                Move +1         200 JP
                                Total:         1030 JP
                                
                           In the spot marked 'Origin', I list the job that
                           this command set is used for, if it is used as 
                           an innate command set. If more than one class
                           exists with the same name, I give the two-digit
                           hex identifier that can be used to find the class
                           in the class compendium. If the command set is not
                           innately set for any class, I list the name of the 
                           unit that has this command set in battle. (1) here 
                           means the unit has it set as a primary command, (2) 
                           means it's set as a secondary. There are also some 
                           abbreviated battle names, used where you fight the
                           same unit more than once:
                           
                           Riovanes ..... Inside Riovanes Castle
                           Inside Lim ... Inside Limberry Castle

This chart is designed to take advantage of the 'Search'/'Find' feature in
most web browsers and text editors. To find a specific entry, search for the
name of the command set within [SQUARE BRACKETS].

To find more information about a specific ability, search for the ability's
name within [square brackets]. This will take you to the right spot in 
either section 3.3 (for action abilities) or part 6 (for reaction, support,
and movement abilities).

* This FAQ is dedicated to Dr Gamewiz (1936-1999), whose years of selfless    *
* service were an inspiration. The Doc, as he was affectionately called, ran  *
* a forum on America Online for many years, founded on the principle of       *
* 'gamesters helping gamesters'.  It was the best place on AOL to find hints, *
* codes, walkthroughs, and altogether nice people, united by the Gamewiz      *
* slogan, 'BOOLAH!'.  Everyone who regularly visited the Gamewiz forum        *
* agreed:  there was just something wonderful and magical about it.  Many     *
* friendships were forged there, some of which are still going strong.  In    *
* 1997, however, AOL terminated its contract with the Doc, opting instead to  *
* back Antagonist Online, a larger, more impersonal forum. Though many        *
* regulars became disaffected, the Doc, ever the optimist, continued          *
* assiduously preparing the newsletters and kept running his trivia games.    *
* Even in the face of terminal cancer, the Doc rarely missed an issue.  On    *
* September 28, 1999, Dr Gamewiz passed away -- even his eternal optimism     *
* could not ward off the terrible disease.  And so, Doc, this FAQ is for      *
* you.  Wherever you are now, I hope it makes you smile.  Thanks for giving   *
* so much of yourself, and know that your work does not go unappreciated.     *
* BOOLAH!                                                                     *

critique of version 1.5 of the FAQ and the contribution of
several pieces of information.  Thanks also to Master Daravon
<beefstew99@aol.com>, who pointed out the inaccuracies in the 
monster abilities section in version 2.01.  In addition, kudos
to Aaditya Rangan <rangan@math.berkeley.edu> for dealing with 
all the game-flow stuff, which all happens to quickly within 
the game for me to deal with <grin>.  Finally, thanks to all the 
regulars on the GameFAQs FFT Message Board
