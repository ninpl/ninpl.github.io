(1r) REVISIONS
==============

[ 0.5.0 -- April 3, 2008 ]

- Converted all fan-translated Status, Materia, Item, and Parameter names to

- Added info to some Materia in (1m) MATERIA LIST.
- Added two more rules to (2f) BASIC RULES OF FUSION.

  worrying of accidentally using up "rare" Materia.

(2r) READ ME FIRST
==================
   
This section contains important info about this file!  Please read this
thoroughly before e-mailing since if your questions are answered in this file,
I will *NOT* reply.

1)  I am NOT affiliated with Square Enix.  I am merely a fan of their works
    and as such, it should be noted that this guide is a non-profit, fan-made
    piece of work.  It is all right to post this at your site but it is NOT
    all right to modify it in any way, sell it, or to claim ownership over
    it.

2)  This guide was initially written before the English version of the game
    came out.  I have since changed all the fan-translated Materia, Item,
    and Parameter names to the official ones.  However, I left in some origi-
    nal Japanese text for the benefit of those playing the Japanese version
    (plus it's more work than it's worth to remove all the kanji and kana.
    :P)

3)  For the charts, you may want to consider printing them out on separate
    sheets of paper since it'll make for more easy reading and referencing
    than scrolling up and down on the computer screen.

4)  It really helps if you know the basic mechanics of the game before per-
    using this file -- specifically, HOW to equip and use Materia.

5)  The items and accessories in this guide only list their grade level and
    the quantity required for fusion.  Since this is NOT an items and/or
    accessories guide, I WILL NOT go into detail as to WHAT they do and WHERE
    you can find them.  Please refer to other guides for that information.
    
6)  DO NOT write to me asking for the easiest way to get Zack's defense up to
    255 or anything to that effect.  You will be wasting your time since the
    purpose of this guide is to GIVE YOU the knowledge to achieve what you
    want from Materia fusions.  Whether there are shortcuts or not, go dis-
    cover them yourself.
    
7)  To see the gibberish text in this file, you'll have to switch your brow-
    ser's character encoding to Japanese Shift-JIS or use a text editor capa-
    ble of displaying Shift-JIS.

8)  My e-mail address is at the top of this document underneath the title. To
    e-mail me, substitute the ~AT~ and ~DOT~ with their respective symbols.
    Corrections, additions, critiques, and compliments are welcomed.

(1m) MATERIA LIST 
==================

Materia are your ticket to success in this game.  Of course, you CAN go
through the entire game without equipping any but why be so masochistic?
With Materia, you can cast magic, use special skills, enhance stats, and a
whole lot more which makes your life and Zack's life a heck of a lot easier
in the long run.

There are a total of 143 obtainable Materia in the game and they are divided
onto 4 categories:  Magic, Command, Independent, and Support.

Magic type Materia can be offensive, restorative, or defensive.  Their colours
are dark green, green, yellow respectively.

Command Materia enable Zack perform various physical techniques as well as
allow him to steal and hurl money at enemies.  Contrary to what you might
think, the money being chucked at enemies is used to hurt them, not pay them.
These Materia are bronze and gold in colour.

The third category is Independent Materia.  They come in two shades of purple
and these ones help Zack by either boosting his stats, grant him the ability
to double cast magic, increase his running speed around the battlefield, or
make certain DMW reels appear more often.

Finally, there are Support Materia (dark and light blue).  Most of these
consist of attacking with or defending against status effects and attributes
as well as SP expenditure to help with offense and defense.  Oh, the Materia
that lets you peep at the enemy's HP is also in this group.

Notes!
- The following list will be the only time you will see the Japanese names
  of the Materia so if you have to search further in this file, search
  with the English name.
- All Materia are listed in their default arrangements in the Materia menu.
  So, sorry, no alphabetical order. :P

Costly Punch | すてみパンチ | ATK (力)

Description:  Like the three punches above, enemy defense means
              nothing.  Consumes HP.  Will increase in damage the
              lower Zack's HP is.

              This Materia is also a bit of a gamble though as
              once Zack's HP reaches 1.11 times above his cur-
              rent maximum HP, he will do 0 damage.  So basi-
              cally, anytime HP goes into BREAK mode, just let
              Zack take a beating so his health goes back to
              or below the max HP and he'll dish out major
              damage.
              
              If HP is in BREAK outside of battle, unequip Ma-
              teria or accessories that are boosting HP to bring
              his hitpoints back down.  Remember to re-equip them
              though. :P

(1f) INTRODUCTION TO MATERIA FUSION
===================================

Isn't it strange how the game doesn't give a thorough tutorial of Materia fu-
sion?  Yes, it's obvious that it's about mashing two Materia together to get a
new Materia.  Well, that's one aspect of it.  The other part of it is combi-
ning two Materia and an item as a means to boost stats.  In fact, doing fu-
sion with items is the ONLY way to max out Zack's stats; getting him to level
99 means almost nothing.

But what determines the result you get?  Why is it that sometimes a seemingly
completely unrelated Materia ends up as the final product?  How the heck does
one boost the stat on Costly Punch or change it into another stat?  Why does
the parameter change even when an item isn't used?

This following sections strive to explain the concepts used to figure how syn-
thesis works so players can minimize the amount of guesswork and trial and
error.

However, before any mixing should be done, it'd be a good idea to familiarize
yourself with the fundamentals:

1)  Surely, you don't need to know that, to fuse, you need to go to the
    マテリア合成 (Materia Fusion) menu, select one Materia to put in the first
    Materia slot and another Materia to put in the second Materia slot and
    then choose 決定 (it literally means "decision"), do you?

2)  Before committing to a fusion, you get a preview of the result as well as
    your current SP and the amount of SP required to do the synthesis.  If you
    lack the needed SP, the game will flag you.  If that happens, convert some
    Materia into SP (from the Materia menu) or sic Zack on some Movers and
    their relatives.  (See FAQ [Q3] in regards to enemies that reward you with
    oodles of SP.)
    
    To cancel the process, simply choose いいえ (No) or hit the X button.
    Otherwise, select はい (Yes).
    
3)  The Item slot will never appear until you obtain the key item, Item Fusion
    Tome (アイテム合成の書), from mission 7-2-1.  Do this simply by defeating
    the mission boss.
    
    And when the slot does appear, it'll be under the two Materia ones.
    
4)  A newly produced Materia will appear in the first available line in the
    Materia inventory.

Now with all that out of the way, you'll need to understand some terms before
proceeding further into this guide!

Materia Level = The level of an individual Materia.  It can be from level 1
                to Master (or level 5).  

                An increase in a level occurs when either two or all three DMW
                reels display the exact same number.  This number MUST corre-
                spond with the Materia slot the Materia is equipped in.  For
                example, Cure is in the second slot and the reels show 212,
                221, 122, or 222.  If two numbers are the same, the Materia
                will level up once.  If all three numbers are the same, the
                Materia levels up twice.
                
                A level up also occurs when the Moogle summon ability, Moogle
                Power, happens.  In this instance, ALL equipped Materia are
                affected and they level up the number of times indicated by
                the level of the summon.  Example~ Level 5 Moogle Power maxes
                out all Materia to Master level.
                
                The benefits of levelling is that Materia increase in power
                and the parameter -- whether default or modified -- attached to
                them also increase which gives Zack some helpful boosts in his
                stats.
                
                In Materia fusion, the level of the resulting Materia will
                only change if a new Materia is formed.  The level will be 1.
                Otherwise, if the Materia that comes out of a combining pro-
                cess is the same as one of the Materia that was used, the
                level will remain the same.
                
Materia Grade = A grade is what the game uses to weigh the "value" of one
                Materia against another.  The scale is from grade 1 (lowest)
                to grade 8 (highest).  Understanding this is vital in properly
                obtaining the results you want.  See (5f) GRADE LIST.
                
Materia Class = This is different than the categories in that all like-Materia
                are further divided into smaller groups; that is, all restora-
                tive Materia are grouped together, all Punch-type Materia are
                in their own little clique, etc.  See (3f) MATERIA CLASSES.
                
Now we are ready to move onto the rules!

(2f) BASIC RULES OF MATERIA FUSION
==================================

Although the grades of each Materia have not been shown yet, still try and
understand these concepts as they will help you make sense of the sections
4f and 5f.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
!                                                                           !
! 1.  The placement of the Materia has no effect on the outcome UNLESS they !
!     both are of the same grade AND level.                                 !
!                                                                           !
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Fiddle around with some combinations and various levels and you will see
some differences!

In the following examples, both Materia are of grade 2 but same level:

  Silence Blade Lv. 1
+ Drain Lv. 1
  -------------------
  Osmose Blade Lv. 1
  
Now let's reverse the positions of the fusion Materia.

  Drain Lv. 1
+ Silence Blade Lv. 1
  -------------------
  Drain Lv. 1
  
Do note that there are Materia that will never retain their traits such as
those in the Other class.  In such a case, placement is ignored and rule #3
comes in effect.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
!                                                                           !
! 2.  If the grades are the same between both Materia but their levels are  !
!     different, then the higher level Materia will be the base.            !
!                                                                           !
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Let's use Silence Blade and Drain again for conveninece's sake.

  Silence Blade Lv. 4
+ Drain Lv. 1
  -------------------
  Osmose Blade Lv. 1
  
And by flipping the two Materia around, we get ...
  
  Drain Lv. 1
+ Silence Blade Lv. 4
  -------------------
  Osmose Blade Lv. 1
  
These examples simply show that Silence Blade Lv. 4 was always the determinant
regardless of whether it was on the top slot or the bottom slot in the fusion.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
!                                                                         !
! 3. The higher grade Materia serves as the base between the two Materia  !
!    and is the determinant of the product.                               !
!                                                                         !
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
This is the probably the most ultilized rule outsince chances are, much of
the fusion that players do will consist of Materias of the same level but
of different grades.

Easiest way to visualize this is to conjure up demented, illogical math equa-
tions such as 2 + 1 = 2 or 7 + 4 = 7 or 6 + 5 = 6.  These numbers symbolize
grade levels.

Basically, the general rule of thumb is that the Materia you get from any
union will have the same grade as the highest grade Materia that was used.
Once you start throwing in Master Materia and items though ...


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
!                                                                           !
! 4. If the level of one of the two Materia is at Master level, the product !
!    grade will increase by 1. If both are Master Materia, then the grade   !
!    will increase by 2.                                                    !
!                                                                           !
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Using the highly illogical equations again as examples, we can view this rule
as this.  Keep in mind that the numbers are grades not levels:

Master 2 + 1 = 3 -- In this example, a merging with level 1 - 4 Materia would
                    have resulted in a grade 2.  But because there was a Mas-
                    ter level Materia involved, the product grade was in-
                    creased by 1.

Master 1 + Master 3 = 5 -- The product would have been 3 if no Master levels
                           were involved.  Due to the fact that both Materia
                           were at their max levels, the 3 becomes a 5 since
                           the end grade is boosted by 2.

Master 7 + Master 4 = 8 -- Remember that 8 is the maximum grade.
 
 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
!                                                                         !
! 5. An item grade can determine the maximum grade of the resulting Mate- !
!    ria.                                                                 !
!                                                                         !
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What this means is that if an item is used during a fusion, the product's
grade can increase if the grade of both Materia are lower than the item.
However, if the grade of either Materia is higher than that of the item's,
then the item grade is ignored.

But!  This isn't as straight forward as any of the above rules!  The trick
with item fusion is that for every quantity of 1 added to the item, the
grade of the resulting Materia is increased by 1 until its grade matches
that of the item's grade.

Example A:

1) MBarrier + Gravity + 1x Mythril Armlet = Elemental Ward
2) MBarrier + Gravity + 2x Mythril Armlet = Elemental Ward
3) MBarrier + Gravity + 3x Mythril Armlet = Elemental Ward
4) MBarrier + Gravity + 4x Mythril Armlet = Wall

Explanation:

MBarrier is a grade 3 Defensive Materia
Gravity is a grade 2 Gravity Materia
Mythril Armlet is a grade 7 item

Obviously, the item had the highest grade so it influenced the outcome.

Aside from the grade level, the Materia classes also played a role in 
this.  For the example above, it was Defensive class + Gravity class + 
Item = Defensive Class.  (Don't worry -- you'll get a better understanding
of all this in the sections that follow.)

So why all the Elemental Wards and Wall then?  Here are the reasons:

1)  3 + 2 + 7 = 3 (+ 1) which resulted in a grade 4 Defensive Materia.
2)  3 + 2 + 7 = 3 (+ 2) which resulted in a grade 5 Defensive Materia.
3)  3 + 2 + 7 = 3 (+ 3) which resulted in a grade 6 Defensive Materia.
4)  3 + 2 + 7 = 3 (+ 4) which resulted in a grade 7 Defensive Materia.

Note that the product grade actually remained 3 as if the item was never
part of the equation.  However, which each subsequent addition of an
Mythril Armlet, the rank grew by 1.

I stopped the example with 4 Mythril Armlets because even if you cram 5,
6, or 99 of them into the fusion, you'll always get a Wall since it's a grade
7 Materia which is equal to the item's rank.

Now, had there been no Mythril Armlet, the Materia that would have come out
of the MBarrier and Gravity union would be an MBarrier since the calculation
would have been 3 + 2 = 3.

When Master Materia are involved in item fusion, an additional grade is
added ON TOP of the increase an item may give.

Example B:

1) Master Barrier + Gravity + 1x Mythril Armlet = Elemental Ward

This is 2 + 2 + 7 = 2 (+1+1) as the item added 1 grade and so did the
Master rank.  Due to this, a grade 4 Defensive Materia was produced.

Had it been just a plain old Barrier instead of the Master Barrier, the
end result would have been MBarrier, a grade 3 Defensive Materia as there
would be no extra grade increase.

To gain a more thorough understanding of the determinants, check sections
3f through 5f.

Now with all that out of the way, I bring you the unfortunate news that
there are two items that make things even MORE complicated as they actually
each have their own little class.   These items are the Elixir (Restorative
class) and the Phoenix Down (HP class).

What does this mean for you?  Well, after all that mumble jumble above, you
probably need a breather so I won't get into the quirks of the Elixir and
Phoenix Down until (8f) ITEMS & ACCESSORIES.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
!                                                                            !
! 6.  Full Cure, Dualcast, Dash, and all DMW Materia will NEVER retain       !
!     their original properties.                                             !
!                                                                            !
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you ever try to synthesize these, they will always become a different Mate-
ria altogether.  Terrible, isn't it?

(3f) MATERIA CLASSES
====================

Note that this list of the 32 Materia classes is meant to be used in conjunc-
tion with the Materia Product List since simply knowing the classes and base
grades used in fusing isn't enough for successful mixing.

These base grades are used in the fusion equation only to determine the
weight/value of one Materia to another Materia.  It does not represent the on-
ly possible grades in each class.  Almost every class has Materia assigned to
each grade level from 1 to 8.  See (5f) GRADE LIST.

(5f) GRADE LIST
===============

As shown in the list of Materia classes (3f), each and every Materia class has
Materia for most grades.  But what of all the grades everything in between?
This section will list all grades and their Materia of each class.  Note that
unlike the chart in (3f) where the grades there are used to determine bases in
an equation, what you see here are the grades of Materia products.

Yeah, things would be a lot simplier if it were one unique Materia to each
rank but then, you'd have a billion more useless Materia in the game and I'm
sure most players wouldn't appreciate that. :P

Now, this Grade List can't exactly be used by itself since it's like Jeopardy!
-- that is, all you'll be looking at is a bunch of answers.  The question part
of this is formed by consulting section (4f) MATERIA PRODUCT LIST and maybe
(3f) too until you get familiar with the classes and the Materia that belong
to each.

To really get the point across, here are some examples of why you need the
two previous sections:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Example #1:  Firaga + Drain = Drainra
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Reasons:  Grade 5 + Grade 2 = Grade 5
          Fire Class + Absorb Magic = Absorb Magic
          
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Example #2:  Master Mug + MBarrier = Gil Toss
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Reasons:   Grade 6 + Grade 3 = Grade 7 (because the Master adds 1 grade level
                                        to the highest grade)
           Item + Defensive = Item
           
It should be obvious that you would have never been able to know the results
of either fusion without knowing the combinations and also the grade of the
Materia produced.

So now, at last, you are ready to peruse the chart!

How to read:
-----------------------------
Class | (Grade) Materia Name
-----------------------------

Note!!!! There will be some classes where there will an N/A next to the rank
number.  This is due to the fact that there is no Materia assigned to it.

(6f) FUSION LIST
================

This section contains the formulas for all the Materia that can be created
through fusion.

I still recommend that players try and understand the whys and hows of crea-
ting Materia so they won't go mad looking for a particular Materia in a recipe
while another one in inventory could have easily substituted it.  Afterall,
for many Materia, what you see below are just some of the *possible* combina-
tions.

So if you understand the class equations from the product list as well as
Materia grades, you can actually figure out all the possible mixtures yourself.
(It'll be a bit time-consuming though. ^^)

About the chart:
- Like the Materia List, the order of the Materia are listed as they appear
  in the Materia menu (after auto-arranging).
- (M) indicates Master level.  In an equation where there is only one (M),
  please note that EITHER Materia can be at Master level.

(7f) BASICS OF RAISING ATTRIBUTES
=================================

Boosting the hero's stats is probably THE primary reason for players giving
up their free time in life to spend some quality time with Materia fusion.
Afterall, as noted in section 1f, upping the parameters attached to Materia is
the only way to get the 99999 hit points, 999 MP and AP, and 255 on ATK, VIT,
MAG, SPR, and LCK.

Well, all right.  So you'll need some barrier breaking accessories as well but
that's besides the point here. :P

The parameters on Materia can be manipulated to your liking as long as you
know the specific formula used to determine a parameter's outcome.  Of course,
the basic rules of Materia fusion remain in effect.

The equation to figure out a parameter/stat boost is the following:

Stronger/Higher value Parameter + (Weaker/lower value Parameter divided by 2)
+ Item modifier.

The attribute that comes out at the end is the stronger one.  So yes, it's
like Materia grades.  The exception to this is the Independent Materia as
their default parameter CANNOT be altered in any way.

The most basic synthesis, of course, is one without any attributes.  What
results then is a Materia with its basic attribute attached to it.  See the
Materia list (1m) for a run-down of all the Materia and their base parameters.

                               XXXXXXXXXXXXX

Following that, there is a fusion of a Materia without an attribute and one
with an attribute attached ot it.  In this case, the Materia that forms from
this union will have the attribute from the equation linked to it.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Example :  MBarrier + Drain HP+10% = MBarrier HP+20%
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Further investigation is needed for this part since there seems to be quite
a few oddities in determining an attribute increase in such a fusion.

                               XXXXXXXXXXXXX
                               
The following are several examples of SINGLE fusions just to get you familiar
with how raising attributes works.  However, to considerably boost a stat, you
will need a lot of SP, possibly a lot of gil, parameter-boosting items, and
MUTLIPLE fusions (unless you're lucky enough to have 99 of certain items and
can raise a stat in one shot).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Example #1:  Cure SPR+40 + Darkness MAG+30 = Darkness SPR+55
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In this case, the 30 was divided by 2 which gave 15 so 40+15=55.

With an item modifier - let's say 6 Mind Stones -- the final parameter value
will go up by 2 making it Darkness SPR+57. 

For percentages, they're divided by 10% to determine if they're lower valued
(number-wise. Drop the % for an easier time) than the non-percentage number in
the fusion.  Likewise, non-percentage numbers are mulitplied by 10% if the
resulting parameter is a percentage.

All numbers remain as whole numbers so whenever your calculations give you
decimal numbers, drop the digit to the right of the decimal point.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Example #2: Mug AP+130% + Quake MAG+50 = Quake MAG+56
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
130% divided by 10% = 13%.
13 is lower than 50 so it'll be the one divided by 2 which results in 6.5.
The .5 is dropped leaving us with 6.

The final equation will be 6+50=56.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Example #3: Master Mug AP+130% + Firaga Blade MAG+3 = Gil Toss AP+140%
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
130% divided by 10% = 13
3 < 13 so it is divided by 2. Result = 1.5.
.5 is dropped.
Final equation is 13+1=14
14 x 10%=140%

As for the reason some parameters never go up after a certain point, it's
because the maximum has been reached with the item modifier.  So no matter how
many ATK Mako Stones (力の魔晄石) you cram into a fusion, if there's a
ATK+40 or higher attached to any of the Materia you're using, it won't
increase.

If this happens, that same ATK+40 can only be raised if the other Materia
in the fusion has a higher ATK number/value (the item, though, will be ignored)
or if an item with a higher limit is used.

This will be further explained in the next section.

(8f) ITEMS & ACCESSORIES
========================

THE RULES
~~~~~~~~~
Ah, SquEnix likes to make our lives complicated, huh?  Just when you have
fusion with only Materia figured out, they throw in items and accessories and
ATTACH GRADES TO THEM.  Are they really necessary?  I don't think so but for
some reason, someone or some people on the Crisis Core team decided that it'll
be a mighty swell idea to make it so that you can get a completely different
Materia if you threw an item into the equation!

Well, if you have the basics down, the calculations aren't that much more
complex.  All you have to remember is that the item grade only becomes the
determinant of the resulting Materia if both Materia used are of lower grade.
Take a look at the examples shown in the fifth rule under (2f) BASIC RULES OF
MATERIA FUSION if you need more clarification.

                               XXXXXXXXXXXXX

Elixir and Phoenix Down weirdness to be inserted here.

                               XXXXXXXXXXXXX

Another important matter is that the item modifier WILL NOT be taken into
account UNLESS one of the Materia in the fusion has the SAME attribute as the
item.  So yeah, trying to boost Spirit with Materia that have Attack and
Magic Power attached to them isn't going to do very much. :P

Finally, the other thing that the CC team threw in to make every player's mind
spin is item boost maximums.  As mentioned near the end of section 7f, there's
a restriction as to how many times a certain item can increase an attribute.

Here's the list in figuring out what those maximums are.  In terms of attri-
butes like HP, MP, and AP, just multiply the number by 10%.  For 100, the 
limit will obviously be 999%:

An item that requires:
- a quantity of 99 per +1 or +10% boost gives a max increase of 2.
- a quantity of 20 per +1 or +10% boost gives a max increase of 10.
- a quantity of 10 per +1 or +10% boost gives a max increase of 20.
- a quantity of 8 per +1 or +10% boost gives a max increase of 25.
- a quantity of 5 per +1 or +10% boost gives a max increase of 40.
- a quantity of 3 per +1 or +10% boost gives a max increase of 66.
- a quantity of 2 per +1 or +10% boost gives a max increase of 100.
- a quantity of 1 per +1 or +10% boost gives a max increase of 100.

As usual, it's easier to get a better understanding of something when there
are visuals so below are several examples of increasing attributes with items
that illustrate the above rules:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Example #1:  Fira MAG+1
           + Fira MAG+1
           + 20 x Circlets
             ------------------
             Fira MAG+5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The parameter was raised a total of 4 times.  The MAG value from the Materia
couldn't be divided any further so it would remain as 1.

5 Circlets are needed for 1 increase of MAG.  Since 20 of them were used,
simple division of 20 / 5 would tell you that +4 was added to the existing
MAG+1.

Now let's try a more complicated example.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Example #2:  Cure SPR+40
           + Tri-Thundaga MP+60%
           + 29 x Mind Stone
             ------------------
             Regen SPR+52
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Recall that the lowest attribute value gets divided by 2.  Also recall that
any percentages are divided by 10%.  So, the reason SPR was raised by 52 is:

60% divided by 10% = 6.
6 < 40 so SPR is the stronger attribute.  It would also mean that the 6
would have to be reduced further.  So the value used in the equation would
be 3 (6 divided by 2).
3 Mind Stones are needed to make the stat go up by 1.  As 29 Mind Stones were
used in the example, the game rounds it down to the nearest multiple of 3
which would be 27.
27 divided by 3 = 9

In the end, the calculation is this: 40 + 3 + 9 = 52

Regen was the Materia that came out of the fusion since Cure (grade 1, Re-
storative) and Tri-Thundaga (grade 3, Ultimate) results in a grade 3 Resto-
rative Materia.  The Mind Stone has no grade so it was not taken into consi-
deration.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Example #3:  Quake Master MAG+50
           + Quake MAG+1
           + 50 x MAG Mako Stone
             ----------------------------
             Quake Master MAG+50
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This one's a no-brainer.  The maximum any Mako Stone has for stat increases is
40.  The Master Quake already has +50 attached to it.  Case closed.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Example #4:  Energy Master MP+50%
           + HP Up++ HP+30%
           + 9 x MP Stone
             --------------------
             HP Up++ HP+60%
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
30% divided by 10% = 3
3 < 50 so 3 will be divided by 2.  This leaves us with 1.
9 MP Stones should boost MP by 3.  However, due to the fact that an
Independent Materia is involved (HP Up++), the item and the higher stat is
completely ignored.

To get the HP+60% result in this, the 1 is mutiplied by 10% and the HP takes
the 50% away from the MP.

Try using items that only require a quantity of 1 to boost a stat such as
some Adamantite (アダマンタイト) and see what happens when an Independent
Materia is involved. :O

(ex) TUTORIAL FOR GETTING HP+999%
=================================

~ in progress ~

Please don't take this as the ONLY way of achieving HP+999% because it's not.
I've only included this here to serve as a more comprehensive example of boo-
sting a parameter.

Basically, it consists of constantly using Potions and HP Materia.

A = HP Up HP+50% (2 x HP Up + 80 Potions)
B = HP Up HP+50% (2 x HP Up + 80 Potions)
C = HP Up HP+100% (A + B + 60 Potions.  Yes, it's 60 Potions here not 80.)

Now do another round of A + B = C so you have 2 x HP Up HP+100%.

Fuse them together to get HP Up HP+150%.

Repeat everything above to get yet another HP Up HP+150% Mash the two HP Up
HP+150% to get HP+220%.

Keep making either HP+50% or HP+100% and combining them with the HP Up Materia
that already has a large HP value next to it.

Alternatively, you can substitute Potions with other HP-increasing items.  How-
ever, take heed of the boost limit for those other items.

Note that this above method DOES NOT COME CHEAP since you'll be spending quite
a bit of time buying (or stealing) Potions and HP Up Materia.  Also take into 
account that the higher the attribute, the more SP is needed to successfully
complete a fusion.

(1q) FAQs
=========

[Q1] What's the fastest/easiest/best way to get < Name of Parameter >+100 or
     +999% on < Name of Materia >?
       
[A1] See point number 6 under (2r) READ ME FIRST.

                                  *******

[Q2] What are the best Materia to have/use/equip?

[A2] This is only something you can really answer yourself.  Every player is
     different.  I know a lot of fans are quite partial to Darkness but I've
     never been a big fan of it.  Sure, it can help you take out the damnable
     Grand Horn from 2-4-6 but aside from that, I hardly used it.

     Although there is one thing I can agree with and it's the general consen-
     sus that Costly Punch is very VERY useful.

                                  *******

[Q3] I need lots of gil and SP for fusion!  What are the best places for them?

[A3] For gil, the Tonberry Guards and Tonberry Kings from mission 9-4-5
     (ソルジャーだけの世界) give 5000 and 10000 Gil respectively.  Equip the
     Luxurious Wristwatch (高級腕時計) and you'll double what you get! :D
     
     SP-wise, every Mover-type enemy (those three bouncing balls of annoyance)
     tends to give quite a bit of SP per kill.  The lowest is 2000 SP and the
     most you can get is 20000 SP.
     
     Movers are regular map enemies in one part of the final dungeon but are
     also found in some missions like 8-5-2.
     
     RE Movers (4000 SP) are found in 2-3-3, 6-4-1, 8-6-1.
     EX Movers (8000 SP) are in 2-5-2 (as the mission boss), 6-5-5, 6-6-1,
     6-6-2 and 6-6-3, and 7-6-5 (they frequently appear in this one).
     Three Stars (20000 SP) show up in 9-5-2 and 9-5-3.
     
     Side note:  The nasty Zabotender in 9-6-1 gives 24000 SP.  They don't
     seem to appear as much as the Movers do though and be thankful because
     Zack could easily fall victim to its death-inducing 10,000 Needles.
     And that's 10,000 Needles as in each needle attack does 10,000 damage
     and since it tends to shoot them 10 times in succession ...

     Now, if you're having trouble sending any of the enemies to their respec-
     tive heavens, you can always fight for enemy drops and steals and then
     sell them off to a store for money.
     
     Likewise, you can get Materia from enemies too and convert them to SP.
     
     Finally, you can use gil to buy Materia from stores and change them into
     SP.  Sadly, you can't sell Materia. :/
     
                                  *******

[Q4] Uh, how do I convert Materia to SP?

[A4] In the Materia (NOT Materia Fusion) menu, there is an option to the far
     right entitled SP変換 (SP Convert).  Click on it and then select a
     Materia.  You will be shown the value of the Materia in terms of SP.
     The higher the Materia level, the greater the SP.
     
     SP Convert is actually a great way to get rid of Materia since if
     you keep every Materia Zack finds, wins, buys, and steals, and you clog
     up the Materia inventory to the maximum with them, he won't be able to
     get any more of the shiny colourful spheres. :(

                                  *******

[Q5] Which Materia give the most SP?

[A5] Well, the higher the level of a Materia and the higher tha parameter
     attached to it is, the more you'll get from a conversion.  Common
     sense should also tell you that stronger or harder to obtain Materia
     such as Ultima and SP Turbo would yield lots of SP.
     
     There's actually a formula to figure this out but since I didn't go into
     any details about the SP Conversion Co-efficient (I can hear you going
     "HUH?"!), there's no sense in writing about it here.  'Sides, who's
     going to sit around and calculate things when you can select a Master
     Materia with ATK+50 and hit SP Convert and know, without a doubt, that
     you'll get a healthy amount of SOLDIER Points?
     
     But to answer the question, the two Materia that can net you the largest
     sum of SP are Dualcast (18040 SP at Lv. 1) and SP Master (24010 SP at 
     Lv. 1).  Between the two, only Dualcast can be purchased so chances 
     are, this would be the best to use.


                                  *******

Dur hur hur hur.  I had the PSP with Crisis Core running at my computer desk

were from fusions that I fooled around with to get a better understanding of
why and how certain things worked and all.

It's the bible for Crisis Core and it's where I got the bulk of the facts.
BradyGames and all American companies will NEVER provide the wealth of infor-

give you everything I provided since the information is quite vital to a pla-
yer's success but I'm pretty sure some other things will be omitted.  It hap-
pened with the Kingdom Hearts II guide afterall. :P

The primary Japanese site I turned to when I needed help with certain things

I have dubbed this book the English version of the Ultimania since that's
pretty much what it is even though it's missing the Mail archive, interviews,
storyboards, and some other little things.  Almost everything else is intact
though.  Strange thing is, they don't even credit the Japanese guide.  Anyway,
I used this to get all the names of the Materia and Items since I've yet to
get much of either in the game. :P  And also, to get a better understanding of
item fusion.

I have to thank my friends for helping me with translating 殺意の一撃 and
勇気百倍！  The translations I ended up using may not be entirely accurate but
I seriously did not want to use literal translations since they both sound
kind of funky. :/  In such cases, I strongly believe conveying the meaning and
gist of something is better and more natural in English.
