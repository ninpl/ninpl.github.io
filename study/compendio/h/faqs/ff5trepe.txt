1) INTRODUCTION

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is my attempt at creating a FFV damage formula that can predict how much 
damage will be done from various attacks within the game.  Note that I'm NOT 
an employee at Square nor have access to their source code or algorithms.  All 
formulas in this FAQ were derived from experimental observations done by me as
well as from analyzing the ROM.  I've also decompiled the ROM and analyzed
certain sections of the assembly code.  Although this means that everything in
this FAQ should be very accurate, I by no means guarantee that everything is 
absolutely 100% correct, nor do I disclude the possibility that I have may 
have missed some things or misinterpreted some ROM data.  If you do notice any 
discrepancies, errors, omissions, etc. or have any suggestions or comments, 
please send your feedback to instructrtrepe@hotmail.com, or post at the SNES 
FFV message board at http://www.gamefaqs.com

Everything in this FAQ was derived from the SNES version of Final Fantasy
Five.  Although I see no reason why anything would be in different in Final
Fantasy Anthology for PSX, I make no guarantees.

2) CREDITS AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'd like to thank those who posted in the SNES FFV forum at www.gamefaqs.com,
particularly Silktail, for his excellent feedback, error spotting and 
contributions.

All the data in this FAQ was extracted directly from the ROM by me, but FAQ's
and guides that I used as references to verify my own data:

lordskylark's FFV monster list at 
http://www.geocities.com/lord_skylark
Macc Maverick's FF5 shrine at http://www.rpgclassics.com/shrines/snes/ff5/

Terii senshi's FFVI web page at http://www.rpglegion.com/ff6/index.htm
Although FFV and FFVI are not very similar in terms of damage formulas and the
hex value codes are not the same for the AI scripts, there are some general
similarities in the basic format and conditions of the AI scripts and Terri
senshi's web page provided an excellent tutorial for me to be able to go on 
and decipher the FFV AI scripts.

Shingo Endo has deciphered a massive amount of info in the FFV ROM and has
a website at http://www.yk.rim.or.jp/~s-endo with a ton of tables and 
documents.  They are in Japanese, though, limiting my ability to understand
them, but people at the FFV SNES Message Boards at GameFAQs (notably Zach
Keene) have been kind enough to translate and point out information at 
Shingo's site that could be used in this FAQ (notably the HP and MP formula
and the hex location of the Exp, HP and MP table).

Djibriel has graciously accepted to host two .IPS patches I made for FFV, at
http://www.tenchinohoukai.greatnow.com in the patches section. He's been 
independently deciphering the FFV ROM as well, in particular the AI scripts 
and has started a Monster AI script document.  His AI scripts are expressed 
more in plain english, so anyone who doesn't like my shorthand AI scripts
should check out his document, as it may be more straightforward to read.

My emulator of choice for this game is ZSNES by zsKnight, _Demo_, and Pharos
at http://www.zsnes.com

The translation .ips file I used was created by RPGe
(downloaded at http://www.zophar.net)

5) NOTES

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This game uses integer values.  Therefore after every division shown in any 
formula in this FAQ, immediately round down before proceeding with any further 
calculation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6) DAMAGE FORMULAS

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------

6.1) GENERAL DAMAGE FORMULA STEPS

----------------------------------

The general steps that are taken to calculate damage are:

1) Determine initial Hit% and Evade% values.
2) Apply appropriate modifiers to Hit% and Evade%
3) Determine whether the attack hits or not.  
   If the attack misses, do not follow any more steps
4) If the Attack hits, get initial values for Attack, Defense and M, using the
   appropriate section in the Damage Parameters section.
5) Apply appropriate modifiers to Attack, Defense and M
6) Calculate Final Damage
6) Apply any appropriate Status Effects.

The exact specific steps that are followed depend on the type of weapon or magic
that is used.  Section 6.7.1 lists all Weapon types and the steps that are taken
for each, Section 6.7.2 lists Monster Physical attacks types, Section 6.7.3.
lists all Magic types and Section 6.7.3. lists Commands and their steps.

---------------------------------------------------

6.2) HIT DETERMINATION FOR VARIOUS TYPES OF ATTACKS

---------------------------------------------------

Use the appropriate section to determine whether an attack hits or not.
Appropriate sections will be indicated in the damage formulas.

*********************************************
6.2.1) HIT DETERMINATION FOR PHYSICAL ATTACKS
*********************************************

1)  If the Target has Sleep, Paralyze or Charm status, the attack automatically
    hits.  Goto Step 10.
2)  If the Attacker is using Aim, Jump, Throw, Sword Dance or X-Fight or if the
    Attacker is attacking himself, the attack automatically hits.  Goto Step 10.
3)  If the Target can't evade Physical (check "Can't Evade" parameter), the
    attack automatically hits.  Goto Step 10.
4)  Check to see if Evade ability, Weapon Block (due to Hardened or Defender),
    Weapon Block (due to Guardian) or Elf Cape succeed (6.3.4).  If any of their
    checks succeed, the attack misses;  do not follow any more steps.  None of
    these abilities can succeed if the Target has Sleep, Paralyze, Charm or Stop
    status or is attacking himself.
5)  Apply Target status effect modifiers to physical Hit% (6.3.7)
6)  Apply Attacker status effect modifiers to physical Hit% (6.3.8)
7)  Let N1 = (0..99)  
    If N1 >= Hit%, the attack misses;  do not follow any more steps.
8)  If the Target has Stop status, it does not get an Evade check and the attack
    hits.  Goto Step 10
9)  Let N2 = (0..99)  
    If N2 < Evade%, the attack misses;  do not follow any more steps.
10)  If the Target has Image status, the attack misses, but the Target loses one
     Image;  do not follow any more steps.
11)  The attack hits.  Follow the rest of the steps to calculate damage.

********************************************
6.2.2) HIT DETERMINATION FOR MAGICAL ATTACKS
********************************************

1)  If Spell Hit% = A, the attack automatically hits.  Goto Step 10.
2)  If the Attacker is targetting his own party members and the spell
    automatically hits its own party members, the attack automatically hits.
    Goto Step 10.
3)  If the Target's  "Can't Evade" parameter matches the attacking magic type
    (White, Black, Time, Summon, Song or Blue), the attack automatically hits.
    Goto Step 10.
4)  Hit% = Spell Hit% + Attacker Level - Target Level
    Evade% = Target Magic Evade%
5)  Check to see if Aegis Shield magic block succeeds (6.3.2).  If so, the
    attack misses;  do not follow any more steps.  The Target cannot evade with
    Aegis Shield if he has Sleep, Paralyze, Charm or Stop status or is attacking
    himself.
6)  Apply multitargetting modifier to Hit% (6.3.3)
7)  Apply Target status effect modifiers to magic Hit% (6.3.6)
8)  Let N1 = (0..99)  
    If N1 >= Hit%, the attack misses;  do not follow any more steps.
9)  Let N2 = (0..99)  
    If N2 < Evade%, the attack misses;  do not follow any more steps.
10)  The attack hits.  Follow the rest of the steps to calculate damage.

***************************************************
6.2.3) HIT DETERMINATION FOR PHYSICAL MAGIC ATTACKS
***************************************************

1)  If Spell Hit% = A, the attack automatically hits.  Goto Step 7.
2)  Check to see if Evade ability, Weapon Block (due to Hardened or Defender),
    Weapon Block (due to Guardian) or Elf Cape succeed (6.3.4).  If any of their
    checks succeed, the attack misses;  do not follow any more steps.  None of
    these abilities can succeed if the Target has Sleep, Paralyze, Charm or Stop
    status or is attacking himself.
3)  Apply Target status effect modifiers to physical Hit% (6.3.7)
4)  Let N1 = (0..99)
    If N1 >= Hit%, the attack misses;  do not follow any more steps.
5)  If the Target has Stop status, it does not get an Evade check and the attack
    hits.  Goto Step 7.
6)  Let N2 = (0..99)
    If N2 < Evade%, the attack misses;  do not follow any more steps.
7)  If the Target has Image status, the attack misses, but the Target loses one
    Image;  do not follow any more steps.
8)  The attack hits.  Follow the rest of the steps to calculate damage.

ATTACK TYPE (HEX: 1E) (Speed up Caster: Drag)
"It gives your party a few seconds 'Wait', after their Active-Time-Bar fills. 
Almost like time stopping around you, as you select a command. "

"I had found out that the battle-speed setting (in the Config-menu) does 
something similar to Drag.  I think to begin with, the Battle-speed is set to 3 
and that gives roughly a second pause (when your command-menu pops up).  Whilst 
if you set it to 1, it doesn't seem to pause at all and if set to 6, roughly a 3
second pause.

What "Drag" does is gives us a pause of just over 2 seconds, (for that battle,) 
which is equivalent to Battle-Speed 5.  Thus at Battle-Speed 5, Drag seems to do
nothing and at Battle-Speed 6, it actually shortens the pause."

6.8) SPELL REFERENCE

--------------------

For easy reference, here is a list of spells that have extra effects or follow
different damage formulas than the regular Magic Damage (type 06) or Status 
Inflicting 
spells (types 11, 12, 13)

******************
6.8.1) WHITE MAGIC
******************

SCAN
Scans a monster's Level, HP, Weakness and currently inflicted Status Effects.
If the monster is immune to HP Scan, ?????/????? is displayed instead of its
HP.  Note that only the following Status Effects will be displayed:
Darkness, Zombie, Poison, Float, Mini, Toad, Stone, Dead, Image, Mute, Berserk, 
Charm, Paralyze, Sleep and Aging.  Also note that since Scan cannot target Stone
or Dead targets, you basically will never see those Status Effects displayed 
either.

MUTE
White, Black, Dimen, Summon, MgcSword and Song Magic cannot be used.  Blue 
still OK, Spells cast by Weapons OK.

SIZE
Mini Status: Defense = 0, Evade% = Evade% * 2
Damage = (3 - Target Defense) * M
M = (Strength*Level)/128 + 2 or Monster Attack Multiplier

******************
6.8.2) BLACK MAGIC
******************

VENOM
Poison Rate = (MAX HP)/16

TOAD
Toad Status: Defense = 0, Evade% = 0, Magic Defense = 0
Damage = (3 - Target Defense) * M
M = (Strength*Level)/128 + 2 or Monster Attack Multiplier

FLARE
Damage = (Spell Attack + (0..(Spell Attack/32)) - (Magic Defense/32)) * M

*****************
6.8.3) TIME MAGIC
*****************

DRAG
"It gives your party a few seconds 'Wait', after their Active-Time-Bar fills. 
Almost like time stopping around you, as you select a command. "

"I had found out that the battle-speed setting (in the Config-menu) does 
something similar to Drag.  I think to begin with, the Battle-speed is set to 3 
and that gives roughly a second pause (when your command-menu pops up).  Whilst 
if you set it to 1, it doesn't seem to pause at all and if set to 6, roughly a 3
second pause.

What "Drag" does is gives us a pause of just over 2 seconds, (for that battle,) 
which is equivalent to Battle-Speed 5.  Thus at Battle-Speed 5, Drag seems to do
nothing and at Battle-Speed 6, it actually shortens the pause."  

(posted by Silktail in the GameFAQ FFV SNES Message board)

VOID
Mute to All.
Bypasses Mute immunity.
Doesn't work in most Boss battles (see Monster Formations Section 11.5)

REGEN
Regen Rate = (Vitality*Level)/16

COMET
Damage = ((50..200) - Magic Defense) * M, M = 8

OLD
Aging vs Characters: All stats decrease to 1 (not Level)
Aging vs Monsters: Level and Speed decreases to 1.  This subsequently affects 
their Magic Attack Multiplier.

METEO
Damage = ((50..200) - Magic Defense) * M, M = 14.  Four attacks per casting

QUICK
Allows two subsequent commands to be executed immediately.

*******************
6.8.4) SUMMON MAGIC
*******************

CHOCOBO
Let N1 = (0..99)
If N1 < 8, use Fat Chocobo; otherwise use Chocobo Kick

GOLEM WALL
Protects from Physical Damage.  Wall HP = (20 + Level) * 50

ODIN
If all targets are Heavy type creatures, Gungnir is used instead of True Edge
Let N1 = (0..99)
If N1 < 80 + Attacker Level - Target Level, use True Edge; otherwise
use Gungnir.

*****************
6.8.5) SONG MAGIC
*****************

Power, Magic, Speed, Hero Songs gradually increase Strength, Magic Power, 
Agility and Level.  Max = 99.  Caster cannot do any other actions.  Damaging 
the caster stops the Song.  Hero song increases Level with respect to when a 
party member makes an attack.  When they are a target of an attack, they
are still considered the original level (i.e. Scan shows the original Level,
L2 Old, L3 Flare, L4 Qrter, L5 Doom work according to original Level).
Love Song = Casts Stop on All
Charm Song = Casts Charm on All

******************
6.8.6) MAGIC SWORD
******************

Magic Sword effects stack with other attacking commands like BuildUp, Counter,
Aim, Jump, X-Fight, Capture and Sword Dance.

Magic Sword Element overrides current Attack Element
Status effect Magic swords have no Attack Element and will also override
current Attack Element (e.g. Casting Mute Magic Sword with the Air Lancet will
make it lose its Air Attack Element).

Status effect Magic swords (Venom, Mute, Sleep and Break) will successfully
inflict their statuses as long as you successfully hit the target, even if you
only do zero damage (use Aim, X-Fight, Jump or Sword Dance to guarantee a 
hit).

For Elemental Magic swords, if the target is not weak vs. specified element
then Magic Sword has no effect on the damage you do to the target.

If the target is Weak vs. Magic Sword Element:

FIRE, ICE, BOLT, VENOM
Defense = 0
Attack = Attack * 2

FIRE2, ICE2, BOLT2
Defense = 0
Attack = Attack * 3

FIRE3, ICE3, BOLT3, BIO, HOLY
Target is killed instantly.
Ignores Dead immunity.
Does not work against Heavy type creatures.
For Heavy types:
Defense = 0
Attack = Attack * 4

If the target is immune to Magic Sword element, attacks will always miss, even
with Aim, X-Fight, Jump or Sword Dance.

If the target absorbs the Magic Sword element, target will be healed instead 
of damaged.  Healing amount = normal damage formula, but Defense = 0.

Other Magic Swords:

DRAIN
Use normal formula, caster is healed by the amount of damage inflicted.  If 
the target is Undead, target is healed and caster is damaged.

PSYCHE
Use normal formula, if Damage > 0, then drain 1/4 of target's current MP.  If
the target is Undead, then target gains MP and caster loses MP.

FLARE
Damage = (Attack + (0..(Attack/8)) + 100)
Damage = Damage - (Defense/4)
Danage = Damage * M

*****************
6.8.7) BLUE MAGIC
*****************

CONDEMN
Adds Countdown to One enemy.
Ignores Dead Immunity.
Doesn't work against Heavy type monsters.

ROULETTE
Random target is chosen.
Doesn't work against Undead type monsters.

vs Desert Creatures:

L5 Doom
Casts Doom on Enemies with Level = Multiple of 5.
Ignores Dead immunity.

L4 Qrter
Casts Qrter on Enemies with Level = Multiple of 4.
Does 0 damage vs Heavy Type creatures.

L3 Flare
Casts Flare on Enemies with Level = Multiple of 3.

L2 Old
Casts Old on Enemies with Level = Multiple of 2.
Ignores Aging immunity.

GOBLIN PUNCH
Damage = Weapon Goblin Punch Damage (if 2-Handed, add GP Damage from 
each hand.  Dbl Grip has no effect)
Damage = Damage - Defense
If Target Level = Attacker Level, Defense = 0
Damage = Damage * M
M = (Strength*Level)/128 + 2
If Target Level = Attacker Level, M = M * 8
No Back Row Modifications
Hit% = 100%
Attack Element becomes None

FUSION
Fully heals target HP and MP.
Reduces HP to Critical on Undead (doesn't work on Undead and Heavy)
Inflicts Dead status on caster, ignoring Dead Immunity. 

VAMPIRE
If Hit is successful then Damage drained = (MAX HP - HP)/2
On Undead, target is healed and caster is damaged.

HAMMER
Damage = Spell Attack Fraction * (Target's Current MP)
Damage is done to Target's MP.

EXPLODER
Damage dealt = Caster Current HP
Inflicts Dead status on caster, ignoring Dead Immunity. 

????
Damage = MAX HP - Current HP

BLOWFISH

Defense = 0
Hit% = 100
No Back Row Modifications

WHITE WIND

-------------------

6.9) OTHER COMMANDS

-------------------

GUARD
Physical Damage taken = 0.

DBL GRP
M = M * 2

COVER
If an another party member is Near Death and is physically attacked by
someone not from their own party, a character with the Cover ability
will intercede and be the target of the attack instead.  The Covering 
character's stats (i.e. Defense, Evade, Back Row etc.) are used to determine
hit success and damage received.
A character cannot Cover another party member if they are Stone, Zombie, Dead,
Sleep, Paralyze, Charm, Berserk, Stop, Hidden, Erased or Jumping, or if the
physical attack was made by another party member.

KICK
Attacks all Enemies
Use Damage formula (HEX: 30) to determine whether each
hit connects and the damage done.
Hit% = 100, Evade% = Target Evade%
Damage = (2*Level + (0..((2*Level)/8)) - Defense) * M
M = 2 + (Strength*Level/256)
with Kaiser Knuckles:
Damage = (50 + 2*Level + (0..((2*Level)/8)) - Defense) * M

BUILDUP
M = M * 2
Weapons will not cast spells.

MANTRA
Use Damage formula (HEX: 42)
Heals HP and remove Darkness and Poison statuses.

COUNTER
Counters physical attacks.
Chance to counterattack = 50%

STEAL
Chance to Steal = 40%
w/ Thief Glove, Chance to Steal = 80%
Enemy cannot evade Steal attempts
Chance to Steal rare = 10/256

CAPTURE
Attempt to Steal after attacking
Weapons will not cast spells.

CAUTION
Chance for back attack decreased from 16/256 to 0

JUMP
M = M * 2 only for Weapon types 33 and 73 (Spears)
Hit% = 100% (not for Weapon types 39 and 49 (Rods and Lilith Rod))
No Back Row Modifications
No Criticals
Weapons will not cast spells.

IMAGE
Gives Image (2) status effect

THROW
Damage = (Weapon Throw Damage + (0..(Weapon Throw Damage/8)))*2
Damage = Damage - Defense
Damage = Damage * M
M = (Strength*Level)/128 + (Agility*Level)/128 + 2
No Back Row Modifications
Hit% = 100
If throwing a Flame, Water or Thunder Scroll, use Attack Type HEX:06
instead.

2-HANDED
Each hand makes an independent attack.
Use appropriate Damage Formulas for each hand.
Apply right hand results first, then the left hand results.

Same principle applies to other attacking commands like Capture, Aim, X-Fight, 
BuildUp, Jump amd Sword Dance.  For X-Fight, right hand and left hand results
are applied one after another for each of the 4 attacks (i.e. right hand, left
hand, right hand, left hand, right hand, left hand, right hand, left hand).

Weapons that can cast spells after attacking do so immediately after that hand 
makes its attack. 

Weapons that execute commands instead of attacking are checked for each hand 
first.  The right hand weapon is checked before the left hand weapon.  If both 
hands fail to execute a command, each hand attacks normally.  If either hand 
successfully executes its command, it is done so immediately and neither hands 
make their regular attacks.

SWDSLAP
Issues a regular Fight command, but it will not dispel Sleep, Charm or 
Controlled status on their targets (thanks to Silktail for this).
It does not seem to have any other effect (perhaps due to a bug?)

GILTOSS
Damage = (10 + Level - Defense) * 150 to each enemy
Gil Cost = Level * 50 per enemy per throw
No Back Row Modifications
Hit% = 100%

SLASH
Use Damage formula HEX: 18
Spell Hit% = 85
Follow Hit Determination for Magical Attacks steps to determine if each hit
succeeds.
Instantly Kills all Enemies.
Bypasses Dead status immunity.
Does not work against Heavy type creatures.

PRE-EMPTIVE
Chance for pre-emptive increases from 32/256 to 64/256

BERSERK
Attack = (Attack * 3) / 2

ANIMALS
1) Let N1 = (0..Level)
2) If N1 = 0, cast Mysidian Rabbit
3) If 0 < N1 < 5, cast Squirrel
4) If 5 <= N1 < 10, cast Bee Swarm
5) If 10 <= N1 < 20, cast Nightingale
6) If 20 <= N1 < 30, cast Momonga

AIM
Hit% = 100% (not for Weapon types 39 and 49 (Rods and Lilith Rod))

X-FIGHT
4 Attacks, M = M / 2 and Defense = 0
Hit% = 100% (not for Weapon types 39 and 49 (Rods and Lilith Rod))
Weapons will not cast spells.

Subsequent hits after the first two seem to follow different rules
in that they do not dispel Sleep, Charm or Controlled status on
their targets (thanks to Silktail for this), nor do they seem to
provoke counterattacks from "React:Physical" in the Monster AI scripts.

BARRIER
If the character is Near Death, they will automatically cast Magic Barrier
on themselves (inflicts Shell status, M = M / 2 vs. Magic attacks).

OBSERVE
Scans a monster's HP and Weakness.  If the monster is immune to HP Scan,
?????/????? is displayed instead of its HP.
Note:  Due to a bug, Observe will only scan a monster's HP (see Section 12.5)

ANALYZE
Scans a monster's Level, HP, Weakness and currently inflicted Status Effects.
If the monster is immune to HP Scan, ?????/????? is displayed instead of its
HP.  Note that only the following Status Effects will be displayed:
Darkness, Zombie, Poison, Float, Mini, Toad, Stone, Dead, Image, Mute, Berserk, 
Charm, Paralyze, Sleep and Aging.  Also note that since Analyze cannot target 
Stone or Dead targets, you basically will never see those Status Effects 
displayed either.
Doesn't work in most Boss battles (see Monster Formations Section 11.5)

TAME
Inflicts Stop status on Creature type monsters

CONTROL
Chance to Control = 40%
w/ Coronet, Chance to Control = 75%

When wearing Corna Jar, will Catch when HP <= (MAX HP)/2
Does not work against enemies immune to Catch

RELEASE

parameter in the Monster Data Reference section.  The released monster
is considered the attacker, so use its parameters (Level, Attack Power, 
Attack Multiplier, Magic Attack Multiplier etc.) where appropriate when 
determining damage.

MEDICINE
Healing amount is doubled for Potions and Ethers (Magic Types 25 and 26)
Applies only in battle.

PRAY
Targets all allies.
Removes Darkness, Poison, Mini, Toad, Stone, Mute, Charm, Paralyze, Sleep,
and Aging statuses

REVIVE
Targets all allies.
Revives and sets Current HP = 1/16 MAX HP to dead allies.

TERRAIN
1) Let N1 = (0..Level)
2) If N1 < 11, cast Spell 1
3) If 11 <= N1 < 21, cast Spell 2
4) If 21 <= N1 < 51, cast Spell 3

--------------------

6.10) STATUS EFFECTS

--------------------
Here is a overview of the various status effects that can be inflicted in
Final Fantasy V:

Resting at an inn or using a Tent or Cabin will remove status effects
that aren't cured after battle, except for Zombie.

Note that the "Immunity granted by" parameter is for characters.  Monsters
inherently have their own status immunities (check the Monster Reference 
Section).  Note that Monsters cannot be immune to HP Leak or False Image.  
Also, the statuses Near Death, Hidden, Singing and Erased do not apply to 
monsters.  Unlike characters, monsters can be immune to Image, Shell, Armour
or Wall.

**********
NEAR DEATH
**********

Character that are Near Death will crouch.
If the character has the Barrier Ability, they will cast Magic Barrier on

and another party member has the Cover Ability, that party member will intercept
the attack and become the target instead.

---------------------

6.11) ATB CALCULATION

---------------------

1) Everyone's ATB is a measure between 0 and 255.
2) Initial values at the start of battle = ??
3) Eveyone's ATB increases at a constant rate (unlike FF6-9).
4) Once someone's ATB reaches 255, they can perform an action.
5) After performing an action, their ATB gets "reset" and is calculated as
follows:

i)   Let N1 = 120 - Agility + (Equipment Weight/8). Minimum value = 1.
     For Monsters, use Speed instead of Agility, Equipment Weight = 0.
ii)  If they have Haste status, N1 = N1 / 2. Minimum value = 1.
iii) If they have Slow status, N1 = N1 * 2. Maximum value = 255.
     Note that Haste and Slow are mutually exclusive statuses. You can only 
     have one or the other, but never both at the same time.
iv)  ATB = 255 - N1

7.3) EXPERIENCE, HP AND MP TABLE
********************************

This table lists the experience required to reach each level and also gives a 
base value for HP and MP for each level.  To calculate your actual HP and MP:

HP = (Base HP * (Vitality+32)) / 32
MP = (Base MP * (Magic Power+32)) / 32

Bonuses to Vitality or Magic Power due to equipment are not added.

The location of this table in the ROM and the formula for HP and MP are from
Shingo Endo's site at http://www.yk.rim.or.jp/~s-endo (the website is in 
Japanese).  Thanks to Zach Keene for translating and bringing this info to my 
attention.

*************
8.1) GLOSSARY
*************

WEAPON: Weapon Name
ATTACK: Weapon Attack Power.  In the Weapon Damage Formula section, this value 
is used for "Attack".
HIT%: Weapon Hit%
GB PUNCH/THROW ATTACK:  Attack Power when using either the Throw command or 
Goblin Punch command.  See appropriate damage formulas for more details.
DAMAGE FORMULA:  Which damage formula the weapon uses (i.e. ATTACK TYPE hex 
value in the damage formula section)
CRITICAL%:  Critical Hit rate.  Critical hits result in target Defense = 0
and M = M * 2.
THROWABLE?:  Whether the weapon can be thrown.
PRICE:  Buying price (although not all weapons can be bought)
SELL:  Selling price.
STATS:  Any stat bonuses that are granted when the weapon is equipped.
ATTACK CATEGORY:  The type of attack the weapon is considered to be.  
If a monster's "Can't Evade" parameter matches the weapons attack category,
attacks against that monster will never miss.  Note that this does not effect
whether an attack will provoke "React:Physical" in a Monster's AI script.
Provocation depends on the command used, not the weapon used.
MAGIC ELEMENT UP:  While the weapon is equipped, the caster will be given a 
bonus to Magic Damage whenever using a Spell with that particular Element 
(Damage = Damage * 3/2, applied before subtracting Magic Defense)
STRONG VS.:  Creature type weapon is strong against.  For Damage Formulas 72
and 73, all hits against this creature type will be critical hits.  For
Damage formula 6C, hits against this creature type will do approx 8x damage
(see Magic Damage Formula, Magic Type 6C)
ATTACK ELEMENT:  Element associated with the weapon.  If attacking targets
that are weak vs specified element, Defense = 0 and Attack = Attack * 2.
SPECIAL:  Double Grip OK:  Whether the weapons can be double gripped with the 
Knight's DBL GRIP command.  DBL GRIP: M = M * 2
Double Grip Only:  Weapon must be wielded with two hands.
Back Row OK: No back row modifications to M.
Magic Sword OK: Whether the Mystic Knight's ability will work with that
weapon.  
Weapon Block: Gives wielder a 25% chance evade physical attacks.  
Equipping either Hardened or Defender will give one independent check.
Equipping Guardian will give another independent check.
Jump for 2x:  Using the Dragoon's Jump command will result in M = M * 2
Initiative:  Wielder begins the battle with their ATB full (always gets the 
first chance to act)
SPELL/COMMAND:  Spell or command that is invoked occuring x% of the time as 
indicated.  Spells are invoked after attacking, while commands are invoked
instead of attacking.  Invocation can only occur when using Fight or Aim.  
Invocation will never occur when using BuildUp, X-Fight, Jump, Capture or 
Sword Dance.  With Harps, invocation can occur with Counter.
Attacking with the Wonder Rod begins with it casting Cure.  Every time you 
attack with the Wonder Rod, it casts the next White spell (Scan is skipped).
Once all White spells are cast, it will start with Fire and proceed through
the list of all Black spells.  Once the Black spells are exhausted, it will
start again with Cure and the White spells.  Note that you do not actually
need to have learned/bought any of the White of Black spells for the Wonder
Rod to work.
STATUS ADDED:  Status effect that may be inflicted on the target.  Chance of 
inflicting indicated in parenthesis.  Killerbow can inflict Dead on Undead.
USED AS ITEM:  What spell is cast when the weapon is used in the Item
command.  Weapons must be equipped in either hand before it can be used as an 
item.  The targetting parameters are indicated in parenthesis:
SA = Single Target, Default Ally
SE = Single Target, Default Enemy
AE = All Enemies only
JOB EQUIPPABLE:  Which jobs can equip the weapon.

SPELL:  Spell name.
ATT:  Spell Attack Power.  ??/16 refers to Spell Attack Fraction
MP:  MP Cost
HT%:  Spell Hit%.  "A" means that the spell will always hit, regardless
ELEM:  Attack Element
STAT:  Status effects inflicted:
Dk = Darkness                 Zo = Zombie
Po = Poison                   Fl = Float
Mi = Mini                     To = Toad
St = Stone                    De = Dead

(n%) indicates Status Hit% (only certain Damage Formulas use this.  Most
will use Spell Hit%)
DUR:  Duration of inflicted Status effects.  "A" means the status will always
      remain until dispelled.  "0" usually means there is no relevant status
      effect. A "*" after the number indicates that it ignores target modifiers
      to duration.  Wall and Ruby Light use a slower timer than the other
      statuses.
TAR:  Targetting: (* indicates that you can target and hit targets that have 
                     Dead or Stone status)
S = Self Only

E = Single or Multiple Targets, Default Enemy
SA = Single Target, Default Ally

Durations refer to the duration the caster will have the Magic Sword effect,
not the duration of statuses inflicted with Magic Sword.  The duration of a 
successfully inflicted Mute status with Magic Sword Mute seems to be 167.  
I have not yet determined whether or not this is affected by attacker or 
target level.

10.23 MAGIC LAMP
****************

Using the Magic Lamp in battle casts a Summon spell.  Starting with Bahamut,
each subsequent use causes the Lamp to use the next less powerful summon (i.e.
Leviathan, Phoenix, Odin etc.)  Once it reaches Chocobo, it will continue to
summon Chocobo on subsequent uses.  After 20 Chocobo summons, it will then cast
Egg Chop on use, which essentially does nothing (thanks to Not Dave for 
confirming the number of Chocobo Summons before Egg Chop appears).

11) MONSTER DATA

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**************
11.1) GLOSSARY
**************

Name:  Monster Name
Level:  Monster Level
HP: Monster Hit Points
MP: Monster Magic Points
EXP:  Experience Received after Victory
GIL:  Gil Received after Victory
ATTACK:  Monster Attack Power
ATT. MULT:  Monster Attack Multiplier.  Note that unlike characters, this is
set, specific value and not a calculated value, nor is it modified by Level.
EVADE%:  Monster Evade%
DEFENSE:  Monster Defense
MAGIC POWER:  Monster Magic Power
MAGIC MULT:  Monster Magic Multiplier calculated from 
M = (Level*Magic Power)/256 + 4.  Note that although most Attack Types for
magic spells use this formula for M, some do not.  Use the appropriate values
for M indicated in the Attack Types for the corresponding spells that are 
used by the monster.
MAGIC EVADE%:  Monster Magic Evade%
MAGIC DEFENSE:  Monster Magic Defense
ELEMENTAL IMMUNITY:  These Elements will never hit.
STATUS IMMUNITY:  These Status will never be successfully inflicted.
ELEMENTAL ABSORB:  These Elements heal instead of causing damage.
CAN'T EVADE:  Attacks of these types will never miss.  Aerial type refers to
Bows, Whips, Rising Sun and Thor's Hammer. 
ELEMENTAL WEAKNESS:  These Elements do double damage and bypass Defense/Magic 
Defense
CREATURE TYPE:  Monster Creature Type.  Undead types are healed by Drain and
Osmose (Attack Types 0D, 6D and 0E), automatically get fully healed after Doom
(Attack Type 17 and 4B), are immune to Roulette (but not the KillerBow), are
hurt by Healing (Attack Types 10, 11, 24 and 42, but not Attack Types 1B and
5A), are killed by Revive (Attack Type 1A) and have their HP reduced to
Critical by Full Healing (Attack Types 26, 55 and 5C) (not for Heavy and
Undead).  Heavy types are immune to Gravity type attacks (Attack Type: 07),
attacks that reduce HP to critical (Attack Type: 0F and 3D) and attacks that
Destroy, Erase, Kill but not those that specifically inflict Dead status
(Attack Type: 18 and 29).  Examples would be X-Zone, Samurai's Slash, Condemn,
Odin's True Edge.  Casting Odin on Heavy types will result in Gungnir instead
of True Edge.  Note that Heavy types are NOT immune to Attack type: 2A (Breath
Wing, Flame, Thunder, Surge Beam).
IMMUNITY:  Immunity to either HP Scan, Control or Catch
INITIAL STATUS:  Monsters start the battle with these status effects.  
(Always) indicate that these effects will never wear off and cannot be 
dispelled.  The exception is Stop which will always wear off after the
appropriate during has passed.
SPECIALTY:  The name of the Monster's Specialty Attack
SPECIALTY EFFECT:  Additional effects from the Specialty Attack.  1.5 * Damage 
modifies damage before Defense is subtracted in the Damage Formula
SPELLS:  Summary of the Spells that the monster can cast, either on its own or 
via Control.
CONTROL:  A list of commands that are available if you Control the Monster.  
Also, if the Monster becomes Charmed, it will randomly choose one of these 
actions to do while Charmed.
CATCH:  Spell or action that is used when this monster is Released after being 
Caught.
BLUE MAGIC:  List of Learnable Blue Magic that this monster can cast either on 
its own or via Control.
DROP (ALWAYS):  Monster will always drop this Item, unless it drops a Rare Item
DROP (RARE):  Monster has a 16/256 chance to drop this Item.
STEAL (COMMON):  What you will Steal from this Monster (246/256 chance).
STEAL (RARE):  What you will Steal from this Monster (10/256 chance).

***************
11.2) AI SCRIPT
***************
[NOTE:  There are a few things I haven't deciphered yet.  Anything with ?? 
indicates this.  Also note that ???? denotes the learnable Blue Magic Spell, 
not something unknown]

This denotes a list of commands that the monster will follow during battle.  
After each command, the monster must wait until his ATB fills again before he 
can execute the next command.  The exceptions are Change Target and Set 
Variable which do not take up any time.  Also, commands executed due to React: 
occur immediately.  Note that "Nothing" indicates that no action is taken that 
round, but the ATB must still fill up before executing the next command.  Once 
the end of the list is reached, the AI goes to the beginning of the list and 
continues the cycle.  

Note that the monster will not follow its AI script if it has Berserk, Charm
or Controlled Status and will not execute any React: scripts if it has
Stop, Paralyze or Sleep Status.

Notations for AI script:

{Command1,Command2,Command3}:  The AI will randomly do one of the three 
Commands that turn.  
Example:  The Goblin has an AI script of {Fight,Fight,GblinPnch}, meaning he 
has a 66% to use Fight and a 33% chance to use GblinPnch every round.

Condition:Condition Parameters{
          Command List
          }
If the Condition Parameters are met, then instead of going through the Default 
command list, the AI will cycle through the Command List indicated within the 
Condition braces.  If there are multiple conditions then ALL conditions must 
be met.

Condition Parameters can be:

Condition:Alone:  If the Monster is only Enemy still Alive.  
Example:  When the Elf Toad is Alone, his AI script will follow 
{Fight,FrogSong,Fight} instead of just Fight.

Condition:Status:Target:Status Effect:  If the indicated Target has the 
indicated Status Effect inflicted.  
Example: the Fairie Orc has: 
Condition:Status:Party Member:Dead{
     Change Target:Single Party Member
     Spirit
     }
This means that if a Party member dies, the Fairie Orc will cast Spirit on 
that Dead Character.

Condition:HP < Number:  If the Monster's HP is less than Number.
Example: If the Necromancr's HP is less than 3000, its AI script will change 
from {Fight,Zombie Powder,Specialty} to {Zombie Powder,Zombie Powder,Fight}.

Condition:Vn=Number:  Variables (Vn) can be set and changed during battle with 
the Set Vn=Number command.  This Condition checks whether the variable Vn is 
equal to Number.  By default, all variables start being equal to 0.
Example:  The Sol Cannon begins with seven rounds of displaying text followed 
by nothing and then uses the Surge Beam.  After this, V00 is set to 01.  From 
then on, it follows the command list inside Condition:V00=01 where there are 
only four rounds of displaying text followed by nothing before using Surge 
Beam.

React:Parameter{
      Command
      }
The AI will execute Command immediately in Reaction to the specified 
parameter.  In most cases, this is done after Parameter has occurred.  The 
exception is React:Death, where Command is executed before dying.  

React Parameters can be:

React:Physical:  Will react to the following commands: Item, Fight, Kick, 
BuildUp, Steal, Capture, DrgnSwd, Jump, Throw, SwdSlap, Gil Toss, Animals, 
Aim, X-Fight, Conjure, Observe, Analyze, Release, Combine, Terrain and Dance.
Will React to each hand if 2-handed is used.  Will react twice to DrgnSwd.
Note that the attacker must successfully hit the monster in order for it to 
execute its React: Script (e.g. an unsuccessful Steal attempt or Stealing when 
the monster has nothing left to Steal will not provoke React: Physical).

React:Magic:  Will react to the following commands: White, Black, Dimen, Time, 
Summon, Blue, Red and X-Magic.  Note that the attacker must successfully hit
the monster in order for it to execute its React: Script.  Will react twice to
X-Magic.

React:Magic:Spell:  React only to a specific Spell (must successfully hit
the monster with it).

React:Item:Item Name:  React to a specific Item being used or thrown at it
(must successfully hit the monster with it).

React:Fight: React to the Fight command only (must successfully hit the 
monster with it).

React:HP Damage: Any time the Monster loses HP, regardless if the attack is 
physical or magical.  Will React to each instance if 2-handed is used or
X-Magic is used.

React:Death:  When Monster dies.  Actions occur just before Death.

React:Elemental Attack:Element:  Any time Element is used against the Monster.

No Interrupt{
            Command List
            }
No Interrupt indicates that the entire Command List is executed with no pauses 
in between each command.
Example: Every other round Sekmet will execute two consecutive Specialty 
attacks without interruption in a single round.

Unhide Monster:  In some encounters, not all enemies are seen at once.  
Example:  Motor Traps are initially not shown when fighting Defeaters.  Unhide 
Monster reveals these monsters.  At this time, I haven't differentiated among 
various ways this happens:  sometimes the revealed monster replaces an 
existing one (Example: Metamorpha).

11.6) MONSTER ENCOUNTERS
************************

These are the various monster encounter groups that you may randomly fight in 
different areas of the game.  At this time I have not specifically identified 
where exactly each group can be found.

Notation:  Encounter # (n/256): [F?]
n = chance out of 256 to encounter a particular monster formation
[F?] = Formation number of the formation you will encounter (look in Section
       11.5 for more information for each formation)

12) BUGS

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

****************************
12.1) KNIVES M PARAMETER BUG
****************************

In the assembly code, it does appear that the formula for M for Knives was 
meant to be:

M = (Level*Strength)/128 + (Level*Agility)/128 + 2

However, due to two lines being in the wrong order, only the first byte of
(Level*Agility) is used, instead of the whole 16-bit value.

As an example, let's say your Level is 32 and your Agility is 4.

Level * Agility = 4 * 32 = 128 = 0080h as a 16-bit number.

The first byte of 0080h is 80h = 128.

Divide by 128 = 1

Thus, Level 32 and Agility 4 gives you + 1 M

Now, use Level 32 and Agility 96:

Level * Agility = 32 * 96 = 3072 = 0C00h as a 16-bit number.

The first byte of 0C00h = 00h = 0
Divide by 128 = 0

Thus, Level 32 and Agility 96 gives you 0 bonus to M

So, since the maximum value the first byte of any 16-bit number can be
is FFh = 255, the maximum bonus to M is 255/128 = 1 (round down all fractions).

If you're interested in fixing this bug, use a Hex Editor to edit the FFV ROM
and make the following changes:

The original data at offsets:

$28313: A5
$28314: 26
$28315: C2
$28316: 20

Change these values to:

$28313: C2
$28314: 20
$28315: A5
$28316: 26

(Make a backup of your ROM, first, of course!!!!)

This will make the formula for M be:

M = (Level*Strength)/128 + (Level*Agility)/128 + 2

This change will affect any Attack type that uses the Knives Damage Parameters.
This includes Knives, Bows, Whips, Rising Sun and Full Moon, but not Maneater
or AntiMagic Bow.

Also note, that this gives a noticeable boost in power to any job that uses 
those weapons.  Usernamehere from the FFV SNES Message Board has observed that
this fix makes them too powerful for his tastes.  For an alternate but more 
complicated fix, you can try the following:

Original values:

$282FD-$28304: 18 69 02 00 85 0E 7B E2
$28305-$2830C: 20 AD E2 7B 85 24 AD E5
$2830D-$28314: 7B 85 25 20 F1 00 A5 26
$28315-$2831C: C2 20 20 BB 01 18 65 0E

$10308A-$103091: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
$103092-$103099: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

Change to:

$282FD-$28304: 85 0E 7B E2 20 AD E2 7B
$28305-$2830C: 85 24 AD E5 7B 85 25 20
$2830D-$28314: F1 00 C2 20 A5 26 20 BB
$28315-$2831C: 01 22 8A 2E D0 69 02 00

$10308A-$103091: 18 C5 12 B0 03 4A 80 04
$103092-$103099: 46 0F 66 0E 65 0E 18 6B

This will make the formula for M be:

If Agility > Strength, M = (Strength*Level)/256 + (Agility*Level)/128 + 2
Otherwise, M = (Strength*Level)/128 + (Agility*Level)/256 + 2

NOTES: 

1) Given the extensive changes required, you REEEAAAALLY should make sure you 
have a backup of your original ROM.

2) Addresses $10308A-$103099 should be all 00. Essentially, I put extra lines 
of code that were required into what should be empty space in the ROM. However, 
it is definitely possible that different translations or other hacks/patches 
have used this space for their own purposes. For the record, I'm using 
translation patch 1.10 by RPGE. If you notice that this space is NOT all 00, 
please let me know what translation, hacks, or patches you are using.  Addresses
$10308A-$103099 is located right after the Monster Stats Data in the ROM, so
most likely and hacks that adds monsters to the game would use this section.

3) It doesn't matter whether or not you've applied the first fix. This one will 
overwrite it.

4) I hope this is obvious, but just in case: if you want to go back to  
the original fix, you MUST undo these changes first. Easiest way, of 
course, is to just go back to your original ROM and re-apply the original, 
simple fix.

5) This fix is a bit different from the one I posted in the FFV SNES Message
board.  There, I used addresses $28014A-$280159 to store the extra lines. 
However, it was found that this would not work on the original FFV ROM, since
it only goes to $200000, and the extra space was added with the RPGe
translation patch.  The fix listed above should be more compatible with the
original ROM, as well as those that use emulators with auto IPS patchers.

6) I've made an .ips for this and it should be available at 
http://www.tenchinohoukai.greatnow.com 
Thanks to Djibriel for agreeing to host this patch at his website.

12.2) POWER DRINK BUG
*********************

The intention for Power Drink seems to be to increase your Weapon Attack Power 
by 20.  Unfortunately, due to the way the game was programmed, it will just
use the original, unmodified Weapon Attack Power when using virtually all 
Fighting commands.  The only exception is Goblin Punch, which will benefit
from the Power Drink bonus.

This will make Power Drink work as follows:

Power Drink will boost the Attack Power for each hand by 20.  Drinking 
multiple Power Drinks will be cumulative. The maximum Attack Power each hand 
can have is 255.  You should also be able to switch weapons during battle and 
retain the Power Drink bonus.  The conditions on keeping the Power Drink bonus
should be the same as the bonuses due to Hero Song, Power Song etc.  Therefore
you should keep the bonus if you die and then are revived, but you'll lose it
if you cast Reset (as it should be).

Note that Power Drink will only work on weapons that depend on Strength.  You
will not receive the Power Drink bonus when you use Rods or Harps for 
example.

NOTES: 

1) Always make a backup of your original ROM.

2) Addresses $10309A-$1030E2 should be all 00. Essentially, I put extra lines 
of code that were required into what should be empty space in the ROM. 
However, it is definitely possible that different translations or other 
hacks/patches have used this space for their own purposes. If you notice that 
this space is NOT all 00, please let me know what translation, hacks, or 
patches you are using.  Addresses $10309A-$1030E2 is located right after the 
Monster Stats Data in the ROM, so if anything, only hacks that add monsters 
to the game would use this section and would therefore not be compatible with 
this patch.

3) This fix is compatible with either my Knife fixes in Section 12.1.  It does
not matter if you apply this fix before or after applying either of those 
fixes, or even if you don't apply either.

4) I'd like to thank Alex Jackson from the FFV SNES Message boards at GameFAQs
who pointed out this bug to me the first place, and gave some good pointers on
how to implement the changes.  I'd also like to thank Silktail who also 
provided some input on this patch as well.

12.3) SWDSLAP
*************

The Samurai's SwdSlap ability's description indicates that it should Paralyze
the enemy.  However, from what I can tell, it only seems to issue a regular
Fight command.  The only difference, however, is that it does not dispel
Charm, Sleep or Controlled Status.

*********************
12.4) WEAPON ODDITIES
*********************

Here are some things:

1) Staff can be Doubled Gripped (no indication of this in the Item Menu 
Description)
2) Maneater is a essentially a spear and receives the Jumping damage bonus,
even though there is no "'Jump' to double attack power" in the Item Menu
Description.
3) AntiMagic Bow's Item Menu Description indicates "Double Grip Only", when
in fact can ONLY be equipped with a single hand.
4) Icebrand is Magic Sword OK and Double Grip OK, even though it is not 
indicated on the Item Menu Description.
5) Excailbur is Double Grip OK even though it is not indicated on the Item
Menu Description.  However, Excailbur will only do 1 damage whether you use
Double Grip or not.  In fact, since it will always do 1 damage, you could
technically say it is also Back Row OK as well.
6) Rune Bell is not Back Row OK, contrary to its Item Menu Description.
7) Earth Hammer is Back Row OK, even though it is not indicated on the Item
Menu Description.

*************
12.5) OBSERVE
*************

There appears to be a bug with the Scan Monster (Attack Type 1D) subroutine.
This bug ends up affecting the !Observe command which is supposed to scan for
HP and Weaknesses, but only scans HP.

In the Scan Monster routine, the 6th byte of the Magic Data (or Command data
if using !Observe or !Analyze) is read and its bits determine which properties
to scan for:

Bit 6 = Level Scan
Bit 5 = HP Scan
Bit 4 = Weakness Scan
Bit 3 = Current Status Effects Scan

However, due to a typo, Bit 4 does nothing and Bit 3 controls both the 
Weakness Scan and the Current Status Effects Scan.

This is what causes !Observe to only scan for HP -> it has Bit 5 and Bit 4 set
which should be correct, but the bug renders Bit 4 useless.

The good news:
This is a really simple one byte fix:

Original Value:

$26E94: 08

Change to:

$26E94: 10

(Addresses assume you have a 512k header)

More details:

For those that are interested, the assembly code for the Monster Scan routine
looks something like this:

C2/6C2A: A5 57 LDA $57 (Load Parameter 1)
C2/6C2C: 29 40 AND #$40 (Check Bit 6)
C2/6C2E: F0 16 BEQ $6C46
(Level Scan Algorithm).

C2/6C46: A5 57 LDA $57 (Load Parameter 1)
C2/6C48: 29 20 AND #$20 (Check Bit 5)
C2/6C4A: F0 45 BEQ $6C91
(HP Scan Algorithm).

C2/6C91: A5 57 LDA $57 (Load Parameter 1)
C2/6C93: 29 08 AND #$08 (Check Bit 3)
C2/6C95: F0 1E BEQ $6CB5
(Weakness Scan Algorithm).

C2/6CB5: A5 57 LDA $57 (Load Parameter 1)
C2/6CB7: 29 08 AND #$08 (Check Bit 3)
C2/6CB9: F0 25 BEQ $6CE0
(Status Effect Scan Algorithm)

Bit 3 is checked twice for both the Weakness Scan and Status Effect Scan. 
Given the layout of the code, it is pretty obvious that it should be Bit 4
that is checked for the Weakness Scan, not Bit 3.

NOTES: 

1) Always make a backup of your original ROM.

2) This fix is definitely compatible with either the original FFV Japanese ROM
or with the ROM patched with the RPGE 1.10 English translation.  It's 
extremely unlikely that any type of translation patch will be incompatible 
with this fix.  If you have any  compatibility problems, e-mail me and let me
know which patches you are using.

3) This fix IS compatible with any of the above fixes in sections 12.1 or 
12.2.  It does not matter if you apply this fix before or after applying any
of those fixes.  This fix will even work if you don't apply any of those
fixes, as well.  You can also freely apply those fixes after you have used 
this fix on the FFV ROM as well.

12.6) RELEASING MOSS FUNGUS OR GEL FISH
***************************************

If you Catch and Release a Moss Fungus or Gel Fish, they will cast X-Zone.  
However, it is the monster spell X-Zone, not the Dimen spell X-Zone that is 
cast.  The monster spell X-Zone is self targetting only and therefore ends up
only killing the released monster, not the original party member who released
it (even though the graphic animation doesn't really indicate this).  In 
effect, Releasing Moss Fungus or Gel Fish end up doing nothing.

If you're not satisfied with having "dud" Releases, a simple fix can be made
so that Releasing Moss Fungus or Gel Fish will cast the Dimen spell X-Zone:

Original Addresses:

$1088C5: E9

$1088E0: E9

Change To:

$1088C5: 47

$1088E0: 47

I'd like to thank Djibriel who found this phenomena with Releasing Moss
Fungus in the first place.  

**********************
12.8) KISS OF BLESSING
**********************

Kiss of Blessing has a very infamous bug.  In the original game:

i) Kiss of Blessing ignores Berserk status immunity. Big time cheese tactic 
that prevents monsters from using their normal AI scripts.  This also can lead
to things like preventing Tree Ex-death to turn to Neo-Exdeath or preventing
recording that you've already killed Ramuh so you can encounter him again.

ii) Using Kiss of Blessing on a target that is already Berserked, Charmed or
Controlled will look like a miss (no spell animation is shown), but Haste is
still inflicted on the target. Image and Berserk are not.

I've made a fix so that:

i) On monsters, Kiss of Blessing will not ignore Berserk status immunity.  It
will still inflict Haste and Image statuses, though, regardless of immunities.
On characters, it will still ignore Berserk status immunity. So you will still
Berserk your party member even if they are wearing a Ribbon or Bone Mail.
This, I believe, might have been the original intention of Kiss of Blessing:
to be able to work on your party member regardless of what they are wearing.
Kind of like how Dragon Armor will still grant Regen status, even if you're
wearing Bone Mail.

ii) If the target is Berserked, Charmed or Controlled, the spell will still
hit (you will see the spell animation) and you will still grant Image and 
Haste statuses on the target.  You will not grant Berserk status, though. 
Charmed, Controlled and Berserk are basically mutually exclusive statuses and
it would be too complicated for me to try to override Charm or Control with
Berserk if anyone was thinking of that.
