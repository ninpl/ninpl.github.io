Section 1:
[1.A] FF1 Game Versions:
FF1 was originally released in Japan on the Famicom (NES) in 1987, ported to
 the MSX2 in 1988 (published by Microcabin), and then in the US on the NES in
 1990 (translated and published by Nintendo). Then in 1994, it was rereleased
 along with FF2j on a Famicom multicart. In 2000, it was remade for the
 WonderSwan Color in Japan, and could be purchased with a special edition Final
 Fantasy WSC. In 2002, a remake for the Japanese Playstation (based on the WSC
 version) was released, which was available separately and in a package with
 FF2 and some mini figures. In 2003, the 2 disc set was released in Europe
 (without the figures), and then on one disc in the US, both called Final
 Fantasy Origins. 2004 saw another version on Japanese FOMA cell phones, and
 later on CDMA phones. FF1+2 were once again released together on the Game Boy
 Advance, based on the WSC/PS versions, but with new stuff. This was then
 released in the US and Europe as FF1+2: Dawn of Souls.

[1.B] Famicom/NES Differences:
The vast majority of the names of items, spells, monsters, etc. were changed
 from the original Japanese version. They can be found in the charts below.
 Most changes were probably made to save space, some were for censorship of
 religious references (Holy to FADE), some likely because of copyright reasons
 (Beholder to EYE), and some were just stupid (Lizard to IGUANA). The 4
 Chaoses became the 4 Fiends, probably to avoid confusion. Most importantly,
 the ORBS in the English version were Crystals in the Japanese version. Gold
 is called Gil, like in later games.
Some graphics were also changed. The man in the Church/Clinic has a hat with a
 cross on it in the original version. The Church itself was changed; the heart
 on the US version's Clinic was a cross on the Church. Most of the classes
 have some minor differences in their battle poses. For example, the Super
 Monk/Master has a different hair style. Medusas are topless, and the
 Beholder/Eye & Death Beholder/Phantom look vastly different. Also, the
 candles found in some places were crosses, and the triangles in Tiamat's room
 were six-pointed stars.
The last floor of the Temple of Fiends/Chaos is empty in the US version, but
 full of monsters in the original. Some minor changes: The Japanese version
 does not let you skip past the story screen with the start button, and the
 options in the weapon and armor screens were highlighted in red.
The version of FF1 on the FF1&2 cart is a cross between the Famicom and NES
 versions. All of the names are the same as the first Famicom version, but the
 character and monster graphics from the NES version are used. You can't skip
 the story screen, the weapon and armor screens have red highlight like the
 first Famicom version, and the monsters are missing from the final floor like
 the NES version.

[1.C] MSX2:
Names and such all seem to be the same as the Famicom version, but almost all
 of the graphics have been changed slightly. Most monsters have more colors to
 add depth, some even have completely different color schemes. Most graphics,
 such as classes, town, and overworld also have more colors for depth. Music
 is improved, but the sounds range from a little better to a little worse. The
 buzz you hear if you walk while poisoned is now a thumping sound. The Marsh
 Cave and Titan's Tunnel both use the Matoya's Cave music, while the Mirage
 Tower uses the Gurgu Volcano / Earth Cave music. There are load times to deal
 with, and there's no smooth scrolling, so the screen is pretty jumpy when you
 walk. The invisible woman is visible. The encounter code is at least somewhat
 different as well. Battles seem more random, and the world map has been
 shifted up and to the left, so enemies appear in slightly different places.
 The buggy spells seem to have been fixed. The Adamant and Bottle stay in your
 item list even after you use them. Also, there's no credits when you cross
 the bridge.
I think a good example for the graphical differences would be like comparing
 the NES version of Double Dragon against the Master System version. While the
 graphics are technically superior, some colors are odd choices.
The game came on one disk, and included a label to put onto a blank disk for
 saving. For some reason you could still only have one save file, but you
 could just save onto other disks. Since the MSX controller has only 2
 buttons, the keyboard must be used instead of start and select. I haven't
 figured out how to access the ship minigame, if it's even possible.
The Black Belt no longer has power/armor based on his levels while unequipped,
 but seems pretty good with his chucks. You can't just hold the A button down
 to have everyone attack, you'll have to push it separately for each action.
 The graphics for weapons aren't aligned well, the Ruby (Gold) Bracelet only
 costs 10,000 Gil instead of 50,000, the screen is smaller, and multi-target
 spells don't waste time on dead characters.

[1.D] WonderSwan Color:
The names of both Beholders were changed, but all other names are the same as
 the Famicom version. This is likely due to copyright reasons, but I wonder
 why "Mind Flayer" is intact.
You can name your characters with Roman letters in addition to Katakana &
 Hiragana. Names are still limited to 4 letters though.
The graphics of everything have been upgraded to 16 bit quality, but the
 WSC's screen resolution is smaller than any other version. All of the classes
 have been redesigned; some a little, some a lot. The monsters are very much
 inspired by the original images, but completely redrawn, more colorful and
 detailed. The 2 Pedes (Ankheg & Remorhaz) have their colors swapped for no
 apparent reason. The overworld map has been altered a little, but not to any
 significant degree. Some other maps are altered a little to make them look a
 lot better (Sea Shrine for example), and to allow easier access to some
 places. "Offensive" things like crosses are gone. Full & empty chests now
 have different graphics.
Some new music has been added. A new opening sequence has a new song, which
 leads into a short version of the Prelude. The church (clinic) has its own
 song. There is a boss theme, 2 Fiend themes, and a final boss theme.
Some minor extra events have been added, such as an expanded conversation with
 the king of Cornelia, and a bridge-building scene. You can now walk around in
 shops, as in later games. The dancer in Cornelia now gives you hints. The
 invisible woman has simply been removed, rather than making her visible.
 There's also a few old men in the Cornelia Inn that provide tutorials. Some
 cinema scenes have been added, such as during the submarine ride and when the
 canal is built.
There's also a bit of hand-holding. Guards wait for you after you enter the
 town of Cornelia, the Princess calls you back if you try to leave the room
 without getting the Lute, the Elf Prince gives you the key immediately after
 you give the doctor the Herb (without having to talk to both of them), and
 the Caravan won't let you buy more than one Bottle. (They sell common items
 afterwards.)
Some gameplay changes were made also. You can now run by holding the B button.
 Attacking after an enemy dies no longer results in Ineffective. LIFE and SOFT
 can be used in battle too. You can also turn these features off.
There's also a quick save, which lets you save anywhere for free, but quits
 the game. Reloading this save erases it. There are 8 normal save slots now
 instead of 1. All items, weapons, armor, etc. are placed in a common pool
 like later games, so item management is much easier. You can buy items in
 quantities, and any shop will buy any kind of item. Spells can be forgotten
 (dropped) to make room for others. You can't board the ship from a non-port
 square, or enter a castle from the side. (I find it annoying.)
Battles are a little tighter and more descriptive. Instead of boxes to tell
 you what's happened, damage and healing are shown above the characters, and
 different status causes the characters to change colors. There are also
 indications of when monsters are sleeping, confused, etc. Your characters
 are no longer separated from the monsters by borders.
Some monsters regenerate HP every round; they did before to a lesser extent,
 but now you can see it happening. Poison no longer bumps a character to the
 bottom, but dying and being stoned still do so. Battles are more random, as
 in: when you fight, what you fight, and what the enemy does. Some monsters
 are out of place, for example: northern river monsters can now be found in
 the south. 
The buggy spells and weapons have been fixed. The Mute status no longer
 prevents items from being used. Warp takes you to the previous floor you were
 on, instead of the next floor closer to the exit.
The game is generally easier because of the bugfixes and better item
 management, to make up for it bosses have more HP.
Since the WSC has no select button, party order can be changed from the
 regular menu. Also, the map is now accessed by pressing B+Start. The mini
 game now gives lots of money for getting good times. You still get 100 Gil
 for just beating it, but now you get some items as well. The credits are no
 longer displayed when you cross the bridge.

[1.E] Playstation (J):
(I have not played the Japanese version myself, so I may not know everything.)
This is basically a port of the WonderSwan version with a few additions. The
 dialog now has Kanji. An opening FMV and a longer ending have been added. The
 sounds are improved and the music is much better. The graphics have been
 improved for Playstation's capabilities and the larger screen size. There are
 larger backgrounds, larger monsters, larger map characters, more colors, and
 transparency on spells. Flashier transitions occur when entering and exiting
 a battle. Riding in the airship now has a rounded perspective view. The
 controls have also been changed to accommodate the Playstation controller.
 (A in other versions=Circle, B=X)  The menu screen music is gone; instead you
 hear the music from where you were, but quieter.
Added features include rumble support, a soft reset (L1+R1+L2+R2+Start+Select
 like other Playstation FFs), and an Easy mode where everything is cheaper,
 you gain levels faster, get MP faster, and there are higher MP caps. There is
 a Collections menu featuring a Bestiary, Item collection, and Artwork
 galleries that are unlocked as you progress through the game. You are given
 the option to save your completed game, as you must beat the game twice to
 unlock everything.
Going from cart to disc has added load times. They aren't bad though, even
 when using the memory card. Also, to speed things up further, the WSC's
 quick save has been replaced by a Memo File, which allows you to save
 anywhere (even in towns or dungeons) for free, but you lose it if you turn
 the power off.

[1.F] Playstation "FF Origins" (US):
This version is mostly the same as the Japanese Playstation version, but
 there are a couple of small differences. There's a brand new translation.
 Characters can now have up to 6 letter names (finally!), and the names of
 items, spells, monsters, etc. have more letter space to accommodate the more
 accurate translation. While most of those names have more accurate
 translations, a few have kept their NES names. A lot of the character names,
 which were pretty accurate on the NES, have been royally screwed with. These
 can all be found in the charts below. The dialog itself is a lot better than
 the original.
The controls were changed from the Japanese version. Circle & X were reversed
 (like every FF since 8, I believe). The controls are also sloppy, and can be
 very frustrating. (This may have been true in the Japanese version as well,
  but I can't confirm it.)
The game comes on the same disc as FF2.

[1.G] Playstation "FF Origins" (PAL):
(I'm not sure I know everything about this version as I've never played it.)
As far as I know, it should be mostly identical to the US Playstation version,
 but with changes for the PAL television standard (it may have black bars at
 the top and bottom and/or run 16.7% slower) and European market (multilingual
 instructions). The tombstone in Elfheim says Erdrick (like the US NES
 version) instead of Link (like the US FF Origins and every Japanese version.)
 It also comes with 2 cards with concept artwork.
The game comes on its own disc, like the Japanese version.

[1.H] FOMA/CDMA:
(I don't know much about these versions as I've never played them.)
The FOMA cellphone version, called "Final Fantasy i", looks like a cross
 between the older (NES/MSX) versions and the recent remakes (WSC/PSX/GBA).
 The character and battle graphics look like the remakes while the maps look
 more like the originals (but slightly updated). The battle backgrounds are
 similar to the remakes, but not really the same. Character names can be up to
 8 letters, more than any other version. Names can be in Roman letters or
 Japanese characters. The dialog uses Kanji. The font is large and attractive.
 The only boss theme is for the final boss. The invisible lady is gone.
The cutscenes, forced story, ship minigame, and the run button are gone (but
 there's an autorun option). The Auto-targetting from the other remakes is
 there, and bosses have the same HP as the WSC. Shops are like the original in
 that you can't walk around in them. The ability to drop spells and the
 quicksave of the other remakes is there, as well as an autosave. Levels,
 prices, and MP work like the original. Items, equipment, etc. work like the
 remakes. You can't change equipment in battle though. You can't board the
 ship from a non-port square, but you can enter castles from the side.
The CDMA 1X WIN version, called "Final Fantasy EZ", should be the same as the
 FOMA one, but I don't have much info on it.

[1.I] Game Boy Advance (Japan):
This version is somewhere between being a port of the WSC/PSX versions, and
 being a new remake. There are 4 new dungeons (one for each Fiend), called
 "Soul of Chaos". They feature new weapons, armor, items, and monsters (most,
 if not all, are from later FFs) as well as references to other games in the
 series. Each of these dungeons has 4 bosses from an FF game, from FF3 to FF6.
The graphics are somewhere between the WSC & PSX versions. The monsters and
 characters are the same scale as the WSC, but as colorful and with the
 improved effects of the PSX. There is a "Mode 7" style airship mode that
 looks even better than the PSX. The colors look very bright and vivid
 compared to the WSC version, and some things are a slightly different color.
 The GBA has a higher resolution than the WSC, but not as high as the PSX. The
 worldmap is mostly the same as the WSC/PSX versions, but there are 4
 entrances to the new dungeons.
The music seems almost up to the quality of the PSX version, but the sound
 isn't quite as good.
Other than the new dungeons, the dialog seems to be mostly the same as the
 other Japanese remakes, with a couple of changes (someone mentions Cid, Jim
 was renamed to Watts, etc.) There's an option for the dialog to be in Kanji
 or Hiragana. Names are limited to 4 letters like most other Japanese
 versions. You can also have names randomly chosen for your characters, the
 names come from other FFs.
There are many new items, some shops have been changed, the contents of some
 chests have been changed, you can win items from enemies, and you can win
 more items from the minigame. Healing items restore more HP, and Tents
 restore MP. You start off with minimal equipment instead of nothing, and you
 start off with 500 Gil instead of 400.
You no longer need an Inn, Tent, etc. to save the game. Saving is now done
 from the menu for free, and you can do it anywhere, even in towns and
 dungeons. There are 3 save slots. Magic now uses an MP system, like later
 games, instead of separate charges per spell level. Different spells in the
 same level can have different MP costs, and you have a "Magic Level". You
 can't learn spells that are higher than your Magic Level.
You can push L+R to run like later games, but only when it's your turn and you
 haven't assigned any actions yet. The map is back to B+Select instead of
 B+Start. The game also seems to move faster than any other version. You can
 leave the final dungeon without a teleport spell.
The new features of the previous remakes like B Button Dash, using Life or
 Gold Needles in battle, and Auto-Targeting are no longer optional. There's
 also no option of easy or normal mode like the PSX version. Most things
 from the PSX easy mode are implemented, and the extra items and MP system
 make it even easier. To make up for that, the enemies seem to have had their
 difficulty increased.
The INT stat actually makes a noticeable difference. Even when using
 spellcasting items, your Black Mage will do much more damage (or heal more
 HP) than other classes, and the Monk will do the least. Stat growth is also
 different than previous versions. The Thief and Monk have been made more
 powerful, and the Red Mage has been weakened (at least compared to other
 classes). The Monk gets affected by each piece of equipment separately, so
 you can have the benefit of wearing a Ribbon while still gaining the high
 defense rating of not equipping other armor.
The bestiary of the PSX version is back, but the treasure list and art gallery
 are gone. The bestiary plays the music associated with the monster you're
 looking at. There is a music player you can unlock by beating both FF1 & FF2.
 The ship minigame gives a variety of items for getting 1st / 2nd / 3rd place
 instead of the big cash prizes of the WSC/PSX. You don't even get the 100 Gil
 unless you don't place. Also, you only need to press the button about 23
 times to access it instead of the original's 55.

[1.J] GameBoy Advance "Dawn of Souls" (US):
This one has all the new features and the same graphics as the Japanese one,
 and features a new translation. Some names are kept from FF Origins, some are
 back to their original NES names, and some are new. This is the most accurate
 translation yet. This is partly due to more space being available for monster
 and item names than ever. You also get 6 letters to name your guys like in FF
 Origins. As a tribute to the NES version, Garland once again says his famous
 line "I, Garland, will knock you all down!" The name on the tombstone is
 Link.

[1.J] GameBoy Advance "Dawn of Souls" (Europe):
This one is just like the Japanese and US ones, but has 5 languages to choose
 from: English, German, French, Italian, and Spanish. This English script
 should be mostly the same as the US one, but with British spellings (e.g.
 "armour" instead of "armor"). These languages are not included in this guide,
 but I may add them in the future.
In place of the NES reference, Garland's line is "I, Garland, will cut you
 down to size!" The name on the tombstone is Link, finally making it the same
 in all three regions.

Section 2:
Guide to these charts:
Japanese names usually stay the same from one version to the next. So the WSC
 name will only be listed if it's different from the Famicom name. The
 Japanese GBA name will only be listed if it's different from the WSC name.
 The English translations vary a lot, so they all get listed.
When a Japanese name is given in Kana, it is followed by its Romanji, then
 my translation. When it's written in Kanji on the next line, and it's Romanji
 and translation would be the same, I don't repeat it.
Fam = Nintendo Famicom
Kan = Kanji version of the Japanese name
NES = Nintendo Entertainment System
WSC = Bandai WonderSwan Color
FFO = Final Fantasy Origins (Playstation) American English name
GBJ = Game Boy Advance Japanese
DoS = Dawn of Souls (Game Boy Advance) American English name

[2.F] Black Spells:
Something to note about the spells: Almost all of them are English words (in
 Katakana), but a lot of them are corrupted. Many of them have suffixes (or
 prefixes) to indicate spell progression, or for seemingly no reason at all.
 On the other hand some are not whole words, probably so they'd fit within the
 4 character limit. I've opted to give the whole English word under my
 translation rather than try to mangle the pseudo-words into something
 readable.
About the suffixes: The second spell in a series has the "ra" suffix. The
 most powerful spell in a series has the "ga" suffix. So we have Blizzard
 (normal), Blizzara (more), and Blizzaga (most).

[2.G] White Spells:
White spells have a few more suffixes and prefixes, and no single pattern to
 all of them. You can find "a" for the second spell, and "da" for the second
 or third spell, or a prefix and suffix (ReHeala = strongest Heal spell). The
 "ja" suffix seems to have been made up for the English version.
The "na" suffix is for curing status ailments (Stona cures Stone). The "ba"
 prefix must mean barrier, as all the Ba spells protect you from one or more
 elements.

In most versions of the game many enemy attacks will have the same name. Every
 ice-elemental attack is called Snowstorm, and a variety of different attacks
 all fall under the name Glare or Poison Gas. In the NES version, these all
 had different names.

[2.M] GBA Auto-names:
The Game Boy Advance version has 10 names for each class that can be selected

 the English name was taken from the English version of the game the name came
 from. In the Japanese FF6, Edgar briefly used the alias "Jeff". In the
 English version, the name was Gerad (an anagram of Edgar). In this game, the
 Japanese name is Jeff, and the English name is Gerad.

[3.B] FAQ History:
:ver 3.01 6/17/2005:
I fixed a few typos from the previous version, changed and rearranged some
 descriptions, and added a couple of things.

:ver 3.0 1/1/2005 New Years Edition:
I did a lot of maintenance, rearraged a lot of stuff, added the thanks
 section, and added info about the FOMA/CDMA and GBA versions.

:ver 2.1 4/21/2003:
I reformatted some more charts, added some descriptions, moved a few things
 around, added some Kanji to some charts, added and rearranged some sections,
 and added info about the Playstation versions.

:ver 2.01 9/19/2002:
I added a couple of things I forgot in 2.0.

:ver 2.0 9/18/2002:
I changed the format of most of the lists, fixed an error or 2, added
 something I missed, and added more to the descriptions.

:intermediate versions 3/19/1999-9/2/2002:
A few hundred minor updates over the course of 3 years added info about the
 FF1&2 Famicom multicart, the WSC version, monster spells, place names, shops,
 characters, classes, and ailments. The last of these was when I finally
 realized that "dia" was Spanish for "day" or "daylight".

:ver 3/18/1999:
The first version listed the differences between the NES and Famicom versions
 of FF1. It only had enemies, weapons, armor, items, magic, and battle
 commands. It was reasonably complete for what it was, but several names were
 still a mystery to me.
