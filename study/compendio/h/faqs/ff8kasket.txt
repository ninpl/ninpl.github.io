Introduction
------------

     After hours of playing this game, trading cards with numerous players, 
including the Card Queen, I've compiled a listing of Card Level Types, Rare 
Card Locations, how to get them, the Items you can get with the Card Mod 
Ability and the Card Queen's traveling pattern to complete the side quest 
during the second and third disc. Also, I will explain the appearence and 
locations of the CC Members in Balamb Garden, and the order in which to face 
them, along with 
the rules of Triple Triad throughout the World.

The Cards
---------

Gained from Monsters, or when Monsters are turned into Cards, Monster Cards 
are the easiest to come by. I've found, that you need to strike a monster 
once or twice, before attempting a Card Transform. Bosses and Rare Cards 
cannot be attained by the Card Ability.

The cards are set up with numeral notations, which denote power levels, a 
number per side, the higher the number, the stronger the side. Most Cards 
however, have one to three high sides, and a low side. Call it a balance of 
power, you may be able to best a card on one side, but be ready to have that 
strong card taken if you leave a weak side open to your opponent. I've spent 
more time with the Triple Triad portion, than the actual Quest, and lost more 
Cards than I care to think about. Just remember to save your game before you 
start playing with high/rare Cards, it will save you both time and 
money...time for playing to get your Cards back, and money from throwing your 
controller against the wall when you lose.


Card Example:

  7
 4 8 : Card Numbering ranging from 1-10, the 10 being an A
  3

(Card Name): Name of the Monster/Boss/GF/Player Card

(Elemental/Non Elemental): Weither the Card holds an Elemental Value

(Card Modification Item): What you recieve per Card. Sometimes, you need 
several of one particular Card to receive anything on a Modification.

-Triple Triad Rules-
--------------------

  Ok...now some of these rules are going to annoy you, but from 
experience...DO NOT, let the Random Rule get spread....you will lose Cards 
left and right...sometimes, ones you don't want to lose.


  
  Open Rule: You can see your opponents Cards, but on the downside, they can 
compensate by seeing your Cards as well. It's a fairly good bet in the 
earlier Card Games, you'll win with brute force by choosing your higher Cards 
to use.

  Same Rule: This is a tricky rule to learn. If you have a Card, that matches 
two adjacent Cards. You'll switch them both to your color. Here is an example:

    4    5
   7 3  3 5
    8    5

    8
   3 7
    6

  The top-left Card is your Card. The one to the right and below are your 
opponent's Cards. If you notice, the top-left Card has matching numbers on 
the right side and bottom. That will change both of the Cards to the right 
and bottom because of the match, or Same rule.

  Plus Rule: An easier rule to learn. If your Card adds up with two other 
Cards, you can change the other two Cards in your favor. Here is an Example:

    5    6
   3 3  1 1
    3    2

    1
   5 4
    1

  The top-left Card is your Card. The one to the right and below are your 
opponent's Cards. On the right side of your Card and the left side of the 
opponents right Card add up to the number 4. The bottom portion of your Card 
and the top number of the opponents bottom Card add to 4 as well. This is 
known as a Plus. The Cards that you make a solid number with, in this case 4, 
will turn over in your favor.

  Combo Rule: I'm not sure how to initate this, but I have taken all of the 
opponents Cards with it. I think it has somethin to do with having a straight 
number set 1 through 10 on all of the Cards. Difficult at best, it can be 
turned right around and thrown into your face.

  Elemental Rule: (From DarkPaladinSSU)Some cards have elements strapped to 
them and when you play Elemental, the spots on the board correspond to the 
elements of the cards. If you put down a card with the same element as the 
space, you will get a +1. If it is no element or is the wrong one you will 
get a -1. The +1 adds 1 point to all of the attributes on your card, North, 
South, East and West. -1 subtracts 1 from the attributes on your card from 
all sides as well. The effects aren't permanent but it requires a bit more 
strategy once you get the hang of it!

  Random Rule: The killer of Card Players. It will aggrivate you to no end. 
I've lost Cards that I never, ever intended to use, such as Player Cards and 
GF Cards. You don't get to choose your Cards, the computer does it for you. 
In most cases, you want to try not to spread the rule around...or you'll run 
into it more often. Good Luck if you play by this rule.

  
  Same Wall Rule: I have run into this twice. It works a little like this, if 
you have matching Cards along an edge of the Triad Board, all of the Cards 
will fall into your favor, or the opponents depending on who has the third 
Card drop.

-Side Quest 1: The Queen of Cards-
----------------------------------

  In order to gain some of the Rare Cards, you must lose some of the Rare 
Cards that you have to the Card Queen. Once she has the Card that she 
requests, she will give you a clue to her whereabouts and move to another 
city and her father will create a new Rare Card based on the one that you 
gave up in a Card Game to her. Once you have the new Rare Cards, you can win 
back the Cards that you lost to her in normal fashion. Here is the listing of 
what Cards come with the forfeit of the Cards the Card Queen requests.

Forfeit    New Card    Location
-------------------------------
Mini Mog - Kiros (Can be gained in Deling City from the man in black)
Sacred - Irvine (Can be gained in Fisherman's Horizon from the mayors wife)
Doomtrain - Phoenix (Can be gained in Esthar at the Presidential Palace from 
the Aide)
Chicobo - Chubby Chocobo (Can be gained in Balamb Garden from the student 
outside the library)
Alexander - Doomtrain (Can be gained in Timber from the Pub's owner behind 
the bar)


-Side Quest 2: CC Members-
--------------------------

  There are 6 members of the CC Group in Balamb Garden. You must go through 
them in order to get the Carbuncle, Leviathan, and Gilgamesh Cards.

CC Member: Jack
  Location: Balamb Garden hallway near the Directory. He has no Rare Cards. 
Defeat him to face Club.

CC Member: Club
  Location: Balamb Hallway near the Cafeteria. Appears randomly. Has no Rare 
Cards. Defeat him to face Diamond.

CC Member: Diamond
  Location: In front of the Balamb Directory. Diamond is actually a pair of 
girls. No Rare Cards. Defeat them to face Spade.

CC Member: Spade
  Location: On the second floor next to the elevator. Has no Rare Cards. 
Defeat him to face Heart.

CC Member: Heart
  Location: On the bridge, it's Xu, and she has the Carbuncle Card. 

CC Member: Joker
  Location: In the Training Center of Balamb Garden, he appears randomly, so 
don't be mad if you don't see him the first time around. He has the Leviathan 
Card, and will upgrade your Battle Meter to include GF information. You can 
find him anytime after beating Jack.

CC Member: King
  Location: Speak with Nida on the bridge and go to the infirmary. Challenge 
Dr. Kadowaki, after defeating her, she will tell you to find King. Go to your 
dorm, and sleep, when you awake, King will appear. He has the Gilgamesh Card.

-Side Quest: The UFO Chase-
---------------------------

 
  There are four locations that you need to find, in order, to meet up with 
the alien. To do this in the easiest way possible, use the GF Ability from 
Diablos; Enc-None. Start out with the Windhill Bluffs, which is outside of 
Windhill. The second encounter will happen on Mandy Beach, which is to the 
south of Timber. The third encounter is on the Kashkabald Desert, an island 
on the east side of the Centra Ruins. The final encounter will happen on a 
pennisula, east of Trabia Garden. Now, return to Balamb and search the area 
where the Garden once stood and you'll meet with the alien: PuPu


  When you finally meet with the Alien, he will ask you for an Elixer, make 
sure that you have several on hand. After 4 or 5, he will give you the PuPu 
Card. Or, if you wish to be malicious, you can fight the alien, and win an 
Accelerator, but lose the PuPu Card.
