Introduction                                                            000
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to my Final Fantasy XI, White Mage Guide. While being a White Mage
is not a very easy task, we hope you understand that when you undertake the
job in Final Fantasy XI.

===========================================
Responsibilities
===========================================

As a White Mage, you have responsibilities to fulfill. Though, you do not
have to help everyone at every given time/point/what have you. By picking
this job, We sincerely hope that you have chosen it to help others. Though,
if you didn't, that is fine too.

---------------------
To Charge or Not to
---------------------

When you hit level 25, you can acquire the spell "Raise." Raise will bring
people back from their state of unconsciousness and they will regain some of
their lost experience back as well. People tend to argue over if it is
right or not to charge people who you are raising.

Crudmonks Opinion:

I feel that is it unethical to charge. Why you ask? We chose the job to help
others, in the process of raising there will be people who will be willing
to give you a donation for taking your time to raise him or her. That can
easily give more than you purchased the spell for over time. From these
donations, you will not have to charge people for a raise to gain back the
money lost from buying the spell. However, there are a few exceptions to
this of course. Like if a person were to be obnoxious and unkind to the
White Mage while asking or even demanding for a raise. I would simply tell
them they are out of luck as rude people don't get raised by me.

Then there is the phrase, "Good deeds bring good things in the future."
Which can always be true, if someone became really happy about it or
something of the like.

---------------------
Raises from Japanese
---------------------

There are some Japanese out there who cannot speak English, causing many
frustrated dead people. Here is a useful phrase that was found on the message
boards, it can most likely get you a raise from a Japanese player:

"Sumimasen. Boku wa shinda. Reizu onegaishimasu. Koko wa <pos>"

Translation: "Sorry to bother you. I'm dead. Could you raise me? I'm at..."

The <pos> in the Japanese phrase will give you the location on the map you
are currently in, giving the player a general idea of where to head to so
he or she can raise you.

You can find some useful Japanese phrases here:

[===================================]

"Hello there,

First off, thank you for creating a guide on WHM since I haven't seen many
(or any at all online) and I was interested in becoming a WHM.

I'm unsure if this guide is still being maintained, but what caught my eye 
was the section:  Raises from Japanese.

A phrase is listed..."Sumimasen. Boku wa shinda. Reizu onegaishimasu. Koko 
wa "

I just wanted to note that "Boku" is a form of "me" or "I" that is only
proper for males to use. So in case any female character uses it, Japanese
speakers may be quite confused. (Watashi is a neutral form of "me" or "I".)

Also, a guide is listed....  http://xeubie.tripod.com/ff11jpn/

I've read through this guide before along with another one of my friends and 
there are multiple errors in this guide (spelling, grammatical, translation, 
etc). One spelling error in particular is the usage of "PT ni haitemo ii?" 
It translates to, "Do you want to throw up in my party?" In any case, a good 
FFXI nihongo guide I've seen with good translations and spelling in romaji 
has been http://shigemo.com/FFXI/nihongo_guide.html , in case you are 
interested.

Once again, thank you for the guide and good luck with your gaming!"

Attributes                                                              001
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|        Agility        |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

- Evasion Chance
- Ranged Attack Accuracy

Agility can be considered a useful attribute, though, you shouldn't need it
to terribly much. Just work on controlling your hate better and it will
become obsolete for a White Mage.

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|        Charisma       |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

- Bardic Magic
- Charming Monsters

Charisma, a near worthless attribute unless you have Bard subbed for the
limited song(s) he can actually sing.

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|       Dexterity       |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

- Melee Attack Accuracy
- Critical Hit Chance

Another useless attribute for a White Mage. After you get past the solo
stage at early levels, you shouldn't be attacking monsters as it draws
more hate towards you, the healer.

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|      Intelligence     |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

- Magic Damage

Probably the second or third most important attribute. Divine spells will
need this attribute to produce a decent amount of damage from them.
Entirely up to the player however.

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|          Mind         |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

- Magic Defense
- Healing Potency

The most useful attribute for a White Mage, despite some belief. It ups the
potency of healing, which means it increases the amount you heal for. Though,
your Cure spell can not go past its cap, unless under one condition. The day
must be Lightsday. For if it is Lightsday, the power of Light Spells increase
giving you slightly more Cure ability, along with various other light-type
spells.

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|        Strength       |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

- Physical Damage

Utterly worthless for a White Mage since you shouldn't be dealing any
physical damage what so ever. I wouldn't worry about it much, like Dex
and Charisma.

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|        Vitality       |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

- Physical Defense

Much like Agility, this attribute can be useful but once again you should
not be getting hit very often, also making this attribute obsolete.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Races                                                                   002
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|        TaruTaru       |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

A very widely used race for all mage-type jobs, White Mage especially. This
race is probably one of the best due to its high mana, however, it has very
low health which can turn a bad situation worse. Though, it's amount of MP
can also keep a bad situation from happening. Due to their high mana, spell
casting sub-jobs are not as required, giving them more freedom to sub what
they want, although not subbing a spell casting job can easily be to your
disadvantage.

Pros:
- Highest MP
Cons:
- Lowest HP
- Lowest Mind
- Lowest Defense

Starting Stats without a sub-job:

Hit Points: 23
Magic Points: 28
Strength: 5
Dexterity: 5
Vitality: 6
Agility: 7
Intelligence: 8
Mind: 8
Charisma: 7

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|          Hume         |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

A jack-of-all-trades which can be easily switched over to any other job if
you wish to. Hume has the second highest MP along with Mithra. Due to its
variance, it is widely used as a White Mage, but generally used by people
who tend to want to play every job without bad disadvantages.

Pros:
- Second Highest MP
- Second Highest Mind
Cons:
- Second Lowest HP
- Second Lowest Defense

Starting Stats without a sub-job:

Hit Points: 27
Magic Points: 22
Strength: 6
Dexterity: 5
Vitality: 6
Agility: 6
Intelligence: 6
Mind: 8
Charisma: 7

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|         Elvaan        |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

The true race of those who seem to be able to govern the laws of healing.
Elvaan have the second highest HP and the second to worst MP. Although,
just because they don't have such great MP does not mean that the race is
just horrible. Despite what people say, Mind improves ones healing ability,
however you cannot go above the heal cap for that designated spell. Be
warned.

Pros:
- Second Highest HP
- Highest Mind
- Second Highest Defense
Cons:
- Second Lowest MP

Starting Stats without a sub-job:

Hit Points: 29
Magic Points: 20
Strength: 7
Dexterity: 5
Vitality: 7
Agility: 5
Intelligence: 5
Mind: 9
Charisma: 7

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|         Mithra        |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

Much like a Hume but with lower Charisma. A very useable race with the
second highest MP along with Hume. At lower levels, the dexterity boost
will provide a nice boost but if you plan on being a Bard at any time,
a Hume would be better. Although, note at higher levels you will have
a little worse attributes than Hume in Str, Vit, Mnd and Chr.

Pros:
- Second Highest MP
Cons:
- Second Lowest HP
- Lowest Mind
- Lowest Defense

Starting Stats without a sub-job:

Hit Points: 27
Magic Points: 22
Strength: 6
Dexterity: 7
Vitality: 6
Agility: 7
Intelligence: 6
Mind: 8
Charisma: 6

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|          Galka        |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

Quite easily the worst possible race for a White Mage. Galka has the lowest
MP but the highest HP. At higher levels, a Galka is very doable with a
Summoner sub-job and a red mage in the party. This is definitely the race
for those who want a challenge, be warned though.

Pros:
- Highest HP
- Second Highest Mind
- Highest Defense
Cons:
- Lowest MP

Starting Stats without a sub-job:

Hit Points: 32
Magic Points: 16
Strength: 7
Dexterity: 5
Vitality: 8
Agility: 6
Intelligence: 6
Mind: 8
Charisma: 6

Job Abilities & Traits                                                  003
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Job Abilities and Job Traits can easily be key components in battles,
depending on your job. As you're a White Mage you don't get to many
abilities but the ones you do get will be very useful. Be sure to learn
what each individual ability and trait does and make full use of it, to
benefit everyone.

=====================================================
Job Abilities                                     004
=====================================================

Job abilities are special abilities for your job only. You also gain some
abilities from your sub-job. However, you never gain your sub-job's 2-hour
ability at all. Abilities with short timers should be used often to extract
their full potential, especially while partying.

-----------------------
Benediction
-----------------------
Level: 1
Duration: Instant
Re-use Time: 2 Hours

Description: Restores your party's HP to full within area of effect.

Tip: This draws massive hate, the only other single ability which draws
     more hate than Benediction is a Paladins 2-hour "Invincible." Should
     only be used as a last resort after you've fully run out of MP and
     your party is near death.

-----------------------
Divine Seal
-----------------------
Level: 15
Duration: Next Spell Cast
Re-use Time: 10 Minutes

Description: Doubles the effect of your next heal spell.

Tip: Wise to use it semi-often as it has a 10 minute re-use timer. Do not
     be afraid to use it often because it is an ability. This is often best
     used with Curaga's line of spells.

=====================================================
Traits                                            005
=====================================================

Job traits are what makes your job special. You gain all your job traits
naturally as you gain levels, giving you personal, forever lasting buffs
as you get higher in levels. They can be very useful, depending on the
situation. You also gain all the traits a sub-job gets as well, as long as
the sub-job is the correct level for that trait.

-----------------------
Magic Defense Bonus
-----------------------
Level: 10
Description: Improves your defense to magic spells.

-----------------------
Clear Mind
-----------------------
Level: 20
Description: Raises the amount of MP recovered while resting.

-----------------------
Auto Regen
-----------------------
Level: 25
Description: Gradually recovers HP over time without needing to resting.

-----------------------
Magic Defense Bonus
-----------------------
Level: 30
Description: Improves your defense to magic spells.

-----------------------
Magic Defense Bonus
-----------------------
Level: 50
Description: Improves your defense to magic spells.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sub-Jobs                                                                006
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

A sub-job must be leveled up separately from your main job as a White Mage.
This means that you must go to your moogle house and set your sub-job as
your main job in order to level it. When you transfer back to your main job
you will still have the level you left off on. Sub-Jobs are also half of
your given main job at any time.

Example:
Level 30 White Mage
Level 20 Black Mage
-> White Mage subs Black Mage
-> Level 30/15 White Mage/Black Mage
-> Player levels up his White Mage a dozen levels without leveling his sub
-> Player is now level 42/20 White Mage/Black Mage

To get a sub-job, you must be level 18 and complete a quest in either Mhaura
or Selbina. Both quests will ask you to obtain three items to complete the
quest.

=====================================================
Sub-Job Quests                                    007
=====================================================

-----------------------

Basic Sub-Job Descriptions                        008
=====================================================

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|   White Mage/Warrior  |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

Subbing a warrior probably isn't the smartest thing to do. It however may
be good for soloing at early levels but that is about it. When you get into
partying, you'll have less MP than most other subbed jobs, which can
drastically effect your performance in the long run. The job abilities you
get also will not help much as a White Mage shouldn't be taking hits or
dealing any physical damage. Although War Cry would be a good ability to
have, it would be at level 70 White Mage when you can have other jobs which
give better stats, abilities and traits.

Pros:
- Defense Bonus (Trait)
Cons:
- No MP Gain.
Pro/Con:
- War Cry (Ability)
 * Cannot be used until level 70 White Mage.

|   White Mage/Thief    |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

Like the warrior, subbing a thief isn't to terribly smart unless you're
soloing at early levels. Their abilities and traits you get are pretty much
useless as you should be staying away from area of effect skills and spells.
Yeah, Gilfinder and Treasure Hunter are nice, but it's much better to recruit
a thief into your party for that.

Pros:
- Flee (Ability)
- Treasure Hunter (Trait)
- Gilfinder (Trait)
- Highest Evade.
- Good job for farming.
Cons:
- No MP Gain.
Pro/Con:
- Mug & Steal
 * Nice to use but can be very bad for the party if the White Mage gets
   close to mobs.

Using a monk is still pretty much the same as subbing a thief or warrior.
The only major difference is that you will end up with more HP. HP is always
nice, however, extra MP is always better. This wouldn't even be to much of
an ideal job to sub while you're at low levels.

Pros:
- Highest HP.
Cons:
- No MP Gain.

Not to bad of a sub-job for a White Mage, though there are better ones. The
main thing you'll probably be subbing a red mage for is their fast cast
trait, which they get at level 15. It can be a rather nice feature when you
get into dangerous situations from time to time, although you're still
lacking some features that are given by other mage-type sub jobs.

Pros:
- Faster Cast (Trait)
- Clear Mind (Trait)
Cons:
- None really.
Pro/Con:
- More Enfeeble Spells.
 * Can help the party but can also create unnecessary hate.

Probably the most wanted sub-job. You get the second highest MP gain and
you get a second Clear Mind to stack with that of your White Mages Clear
Mind trait. While there is a big debate wether or not Black Magic is great
with this sub, I think that it can go either way. Early on in levels,
subbing a black mage will help out a bit from here to there with some spells.
However, doing this can easily create excessive hate which can also make a
situation turn bad easily. Though, if you think you can control the hate
well enough, be my guest. (At higher levels having your sub-job halved, the
black magic will become kind of useless as the monster you're fighting will
be a much higher level than that of the spell you're using.)

Pros:
- Second Highest MP Gain.
- Clear Mind (Trait)
Cons:
- Little HP Gain.
Pro/Con:
- Black Magic
 * Can help the party but can also create unnecessary hate.

A better sub-job than a warrior, although it still doesn't stack up to the
usefulness of mage-type sub-jobs. You'll get more defense and HP than
mage-type subs but MP's importance factor outweighs that of defense and HP.
It *can* be useful, but once again, I would recommend using a mage-type
sub-job.

Pros:
- Holy Circle (Ability)
- Sentinel (Ability)
- Physical Defense Power Up (Trait)
- Second Highest Mind.
Cons:
- Small MP Gain.

|White Mage/Dark Knight |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

One of the worst subs you could probably have with a White Mage. Since Dark
Knight focuses around more of a melee fighter than that of a dark spell caster,
a black mage would be more ideal of a sub-job to pick.

Pros:
- Arcane Circle (Ability)
Cons:
- Small MP Gain.
- Very little black magic.
 * The three stat absorb spells you wouldn't be getting until level 62+

|White Mage/Beastmaster |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

Not to useful of a sub-job. In early levels having a charmed monster help
you out may be ideal, but towards higher levels they won't help much. Since
they're not so useful at mid-high levels, it creates no MP gain at all,
worsening the sub-job for a White Mage. I don't recommend using this to sub
with a White Mage unless you're going through the first dozen levels solo.

Pros:
- Charm (Ability)
Cons:
- No MP Gain.

|   White Mage/Ranger   |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

Yet another pretty useless sub-job for a White Mage. Since you cannot equip
a bow most of its traits and abilities you obtain with a ranger sub become
useless. Yet another sub-job I don't recommend for a White Mage. You're
probably better off having a ranger as a main job and White Mage as a
sub-job. Though, rangers have better subs than White Mage, so I wouldn't
pick it.

Pros:
- Scavenge (Ability)
- Camouflage (Ability)
- Alertness (Trait)
Cons:
- No MP Gain.

|   White Mage/Bard     |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

This *would* be an awesome sub-job if you could equip your sub-jobs items as
if he were your main job. Since you cannot equip instruments, you're stuck
with singing only songs. It would be more wise to have a bard as your main
and a White Mage as your sub-job. Although, doing that will result in very
low MP, but you shouldn't be acting as the main healer if you did that.

Pros:
- Resistance to Silence.
- Sing
Cons:
- No MP Gain.
- Cannot use instruments.
 * Due to this, only songs that you verbally sing will work.

|  White Mage/Summoner  |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

The best sub-job for a White Mage, in my opinion. You get the most MP, clear
mind and also Auto-Refresh when you hit level 50 White Mage. Three very
useful traits and Auto-Refresh stacks on top of the spell Refresh! People
say the avatars suck because you're subbing a summoner, I tend to agree.
Although, you're not subbing it for the avatars you can summon, you're using
it for its traits that you get mentioned above and shown below. I highly
recommend subbing this job, however it is harder to level a summoner than
that of a black mage.


Pros:
- Largest MP Gain.
- Auto-Refresh (Trait)
- Clear Mind (Trait)
- Highest Mind.
Cons:
- Weak Avatars.
- Lowest HP Gain.

|   White Mage/Ninja    |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

Once again, not a recommend sub-job for a White Mage. I don't even recommend
subbing a Ninja at lower levels as most all other jobs are much more useful
than that of a Ninja. Dual Wield is nice, however it's the only thing decent
you'll probably get out of this sub.

Pros:
- Dual Wield.
 * Wielding two one-handed clubs for stats.
Cons:
- No MP Gain.

Last but not least, Dragoon. Like most other melee jobs, definitely not a
recommended job to be. You can't summon a wyvern while it's subbed and the
job traits are utterly useless to a White Mage.

Pros:
- Moderate HP Gain.
- Ancient Circle (Ability)
Cons:
- No MP Gain.
- No Wyvern.

Starting Out                                                            010
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Starting out as a White Mage is no easy task. It is a little bit more costly
than most other classes, with the exception of Ninja and Ranger. When you
buy spells and memorize them, you will never ever lose them. That means if
you change to a Red Mage, you keep all the spells you learned and you can
use the ones that are allowable by a Red Mage!

While you begin, make sure to keep up to date on Cure, Protect and -na type
spells. Those will benefit your party the absolute most, as well as Regen
and a few others. All I can say is, good luck and enjoy playing a White
Mage! It won't be as easy as you think.

Be warned, your first 10-12 levels will probably mostly soloing. There are
not many who party below that due to "bad" experience gain. You can party
below there but this section here is mainly devoted to soloing and becoming
use to the game itself. If you do happen to party though, keep it to one
or two other people until you hit 12.

One more thing before we get into the actual low leveling guide for White
Mages. You can transfer your nation in the game, so the place you pick does
not need to be the one you will have in the long run. To transfer, you need
to talk to some NPC in the town you wish to transfer to and pay him a total
of 4k, 10k, or 40k. 4k being for if the nation is in Rank 3 and 40k for if
the nation is in Rank 1. You can find the locations for the NPC's in the
NPC FAQ on the website here:

http://db.gamefaqs.com/console/ps2/file/final_fantasy_xi_npc.txt

===================================
Bastok                          011
===================================

Bastok, the Hume and Galka Capital of Vana'diel. A very small and compact
city, which is easy to get around in. Specializing in melee jobs for the
most part, this town is not recommended what so ever to start in as a
mage-type job. Ring is also pretty useless for a White Mage, but it still
helps none-the-less.

Bastokan ring
- 3 HP
- 1 Vitality
- 1 Dexterity

===================================
San d'Oria                      012
===================================

San d'Oria, the Elvaan Capital. If you picked your race to be an Elvaan,
this is most likely the Nation you want to start in, even if you are a White
Mage. I say that so you get the nations ring. It may not look good but it's
a great ring for a White Mage to start with. I say it is better than then
Windurstian Ring because 2 Defense and 1 Mind will do more for you than 3
MP and 1 Agility at lower levels.

San d'Orian Ring
- 2 Defense
- 1 Strength
- 1 Mind

-----------------------
Leveling 1 to 3
-----------------------

Don't be afraid to take some time and get use to the controls before you
start exploring. All low level monsters should be right outside the city
limits, giving you easy access without going far and being able to stay
away from aggressive monsters.

East & West Ronfaure
- Tunnel Worms
- Wild Rabbits

Either Ronfaure is a good place to begin your travels outside of town. Out
of the two monsters listed above, you'll find that Tunnel Worms will be a
bit easier than a Wild Rabbit, despite their level being the same. That is
because Worms are magic users, if you're not within melee distance, they
will cast spells on you as often as possible. So keep it in mind to stay
close and melee.

-----------------------
Leveling 3 to 5
-----------------------

As soon as you hit level 3, it is wise to expand your explored territory a
little and get use to your surroundings. Hopefully by now you should know
the basics on fighting. You should now start being careful because of some
aggressive monsters you may meet. Aggressive monsters such as orcs and
goblins.

East Ronfaure
- Carrion Worm
- Ding Bats
- Forest Hare
- Pugil
- Mouse Bat
- Scarab Beetle
- Orcish Fodder
- Goblin Thug
- Goblin Fisher

Monsters now begin to be spread out a bit more, but no worries, you can
still easily find them. Try to stick to monsters listed above and try not
to attack Funguar as they have a long lasting poison which can easily take
you out after battle. I don't recommend fighting them right away, at least
not until you get the spell Poisona. Be weary of aggressive monsters which
consist of Orcs, Goblins, Undead and Bombs.

West Ronfaure
- Carrion Worm
- Ding Bats
- Forest Hare
- Mouse Bat
- Scarab Beetle
- Orcish Fodder

Just like East Ronfaure, spread out and try to stick to the monsters listed
above. Keep away from the even and higher level monsters for they can kill
you fairly easily most of the time, it's not always worth the gamble.

-----------------------
Leveling 5 to 8
-----------------------

Now that you've hit five, go sell all your stuff in town or in the auction
house, whichever will provide more money. After you've got that money, go
buy a hammer! You won't regret it, it is your best leveling weapon while
you are soloing.

East Ronfaure
- Goblin Fisher
- Goblin Thug
- Orcish Fodder
- Orcish Grappler
- Orcish Mesmerizer
- Enchanted Bones (Night Only)
- Goblin Weaver
- Goblin Digger
- Tainted Hound (Night Only)
- Wild Sheep

Now you can almost explore the entire map without much worry. Towards the
bottom of the map, you'll find it to be the hardest in terms of monster
levels. Just be careful of Orcish Grapplers as they are not mage job
friendly at all.

West Ronfaure
- Orcish Fodder
- Orcish Grappler
- Orcish Mesmerizer
- Goblin Thug
- Goblin Weaver
- Enchanted Bones (Night Only)
- Goblin Digger
- Goblin Fisher
- Tainted Hound (Night Only)
- Wild Sheep

Like East Ronfaure, the further south you go the harder the monsters tend
to get. Once again, be weary of Orcish Grapplers and you should be fine.

Ghelsba Outpost
- Watch Lizards
- Toadstool
- Cheiropetra
- Ghelsba Pugil
- Orcish Fodder
- Orcish Grappler
- Orcish Mesmerizer

A highly sought out gil farming ground, making this place slightly more
difficult to level in. The location of the entrance to here is located
in West Ronfaure at E-4. You can buy the map for here in North San d'Oria
from an NPC next to a fountain. Just be sure to watch out for getting a
big mob of monsters on you as Orcs link as well as Watch Lizards. Also be
careful of Orcish Grapplers, they are once again, not good for any
mage-type job.

King Ranperre's Tomb
- Mouse Bat
- Enchanted Bones (Night Only)
- Goblin Thug
- Goblin Weaver
- Stone Eater

The Tomb is located in the bottom left of East Ronfaure in H-11. The Tomb
itself isn't a terribly good place to level. However, if you're on Mission
2 of San d'Oria, you'll need to come here into I-10 of the Tomb map. To
get the map though, you must complete a quest which is initially started
in North San d'Oria by the Woodworkers/Carpenters Guild. Just make sure
not to go in any further when you start seeing Goblin Tinkerers and Wind
Bats.

-----------------------
Leveling 8 to 10
-----------------------

Leveling now has slowed down a lot. You can actually take a party and go
to La Thiene Plateau and level up a bit there, but be careful if you do
decide to do that. Otherwise, if your with just one other person then you
can go ahead and stay in the listed solo areas.

East Ronfaure
- Goblin Fisher
- Goblin Thug
- Orcish Fodder
- Orcish Grappler
- Orcish Mesmerizer
- Enchanted Bones (Night Only)
- Goblin Weaver
- Goblin Digger
- Tainted Hound (Night Only)
- Wild Sheep
- Bomb

Just like levels 5 to 8, you'll be fighting the same things again. Just
head to the southern areas of the map for the strongest monsters on the
map. Be careful of bombs, they are levels 8-10 and have an ability to
self-destruct which can do a LOT of damage, if he starts using the
ability, you may want to run as far away as possible. If you do not
think you can make it, then heal yourself up to full and hope it does
not kill you.

West Ronfaure
- Orcish Fodder
- Orcish Grappler
- Orcish Mesmerizer
- Goblin Thug
- Goblin Weaver
- Enchanted Bones (Night Only)
- Goblin Digger
- Goblin Fisher
- Tainted Hound (Night Only)
- Wild Sheep
- Bomb

Just refer to the East Ronfaure description above, it's virtually the
same thing except a different map.

Ghelsba Outpost
- Orcish Fodder
- Orcish Grappler
- Orcish Mesmerizer
- Orcish Stonelauncher

Leveling has become harder now that there are less monsters you can go
after. Be very careful of Stonelaunchers and do not try them until you
are level 9, possibly 10. This isn't the best place to level at 9, but
produces more experience than either Ronfaure if it isn't overly camped.

King Ranperre's Tomb
- Stone Eater

Due to lack of monsters your level here without going deeper in with more
hazardous monsters like Goblin Tinkerers, this is not a very good place
to level at your levels.

La Theine Plateau
- Gale Bats
- Steppe Hare
- Strolling Sapling
- Rock Eater
- Acro Bat
- Goblin Thug
- Goblin Fisher
- Goblin Weaver
- Orcish Fodder
- Orcish Grappler
- Orcish Mesmerizer

The Plateau is found by going through West Ronfaure at F-12, which is
marked on the map. You can buy the map to the Plateau in the same place
that you bought the map for Ghelsba. If you don't know where, scroll up
and read the first Ghelsba insert. I do not recommend this place until
you are at least level 9, usually 10 without a group. I say that because
you are just now getting into partying, if not you will be fairly soon.
It is a very wise idea to get down the partying basics as soon as
possible and learn all the tricks you can.


===================================
Windurst                        013
===================================

Windurst, the Capital for Mithra and TaruTaru. A capital with a lot of
natural beauty. Natural because you are basically living inside of nature
itself (inside pun). A very good place to start for a mage-type job. I
would definitely recommend this town as it will be slightly easier for a
White Mage to level than that of the other two towns. You might also make
a nice profit off of Silk Threads from Crawlers, if you know what you are
doing. It may seem like a huge city and hard to navigate, but do not worry,
there is a way around it. There are some NPC's that will quick warp you to
other various sections of the town, giving you quick access all over. The
Ring of Windurst would be great for a Black Mage, but you are a White Mage.
Intelligence does little for a White Mage except for a few divine spells,
which you don't get until later levels anyways. (at least for the most part)

indurstian Ring
- 3 MP
- 1 Agility
- 1 Intelligence


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Macros                                                                  014
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Macros are set commands within a game that can be activated at the touch of
a button. They can perform many preset actions, spells, commands, and other
stuff.

To get to the area to edit your macros, first use the dash (-) key on your
numeric pad twice, or click the scrollball on your mouse twice. Then select
the "Macro" tab from the menu. Select any macro you want to edit, there are 
10 different sets of macro's you can have pre-set for different occasions.
To switch to a different macro set, open up the macro tab and push the up or
down arrows to switch. You can also switch by holding Ctrl or Alt and using
the up or down arrows if you're not in the macro tab in the menu.

Setting up a macro is pretty simple once you do it a couple times, the
abbreviation with variables instead of having to edit people's names or type
them out. It is also recommended that you keep the text you use in macros
to a bare minimum, it seems to easily frustrate people.

Some people tend to call them tags, dependent commands or abbreviations. I
just happen to call them variables myself and will use that as a term for
them in this FAQ/Guide.

-------------------
      <t>     
-------------------

Description: Uses the current target for whatever purpose the command was
             set up for.

Example: 
- /say Hello <t>, how are you today?
  or
- /ma "Cure" <t>

-------------------
    <stpc>    
-------------------

Description: Sub-targets player characters. This means that while you are
             targeted with someone or something else, you may use this in
             a command which brings up an arrow to select someone inside
             of your party. Very useful for healing in parties.

Example: 
- /ma "Cure" <stpc>

-------------------
     <me>    
-------------------

Description: Puts your name in there so basically you don't have to

Example: 
- /ma "Cure" <me> 

-------------------
     <bt>    
-------------------

Description: Targets the monster your party is currently targeting and
             is highlighted in red. If you are under attack by multiple
             monsters, it targets the first monster which was targeted.
             It can be cycled through, just like <stpc>.

Example: 
- /ma "Slow" <bt> 

-------------------
     <ht>    
-------------------

Description: Targets a monster that a person has called for help with. It
             will target them in order of who called help first and so on.
             In case multiple people called for help. Also cycles, like
             <bt> and <stpc>

Example: 
- /ma "Holy" <ht> 

-------------------
 <p0> to <p5>
-------------------

Description: Targets people in your party, 0 being the person at the top,
             who always happens to be you. 1-5 is everyone in order from
             the top to the bottom.

Example: 
- /ma "Cure II" <p3> 

-------------------
<p10> to <p15>
-------------------

Description: Targets the upper alliance party members. This works the same
             way as <p0> through <p5> except it targets your first made
             alliance with another party. This party table appears as the
             top one of the two alliance tables.

Example: 
- /ma "Cure II" <p12> 

-------------------
<p20> to <p25>
-------------------

Description: Targets the lower alliance party members. This works the same

===================

Other useful tips: 

When you make a macro for a spell, ability or skill with multiple words in
it, you absolutely need to put the entire spell/ability/skill in quotes.

===================

While making macros for a White Mage, you might find it easier to use some
macros where it uses the current target to heal them. You may also find it
easier to skip macros all together. I however find it easiest to make use
of <stpc> and <bt> the most while being a white mage and any other job for
that matter!

If you want to know more about Macros, I suggest checking out hpsolo's
excellent Macro Guide which explains this in much more detail. It is located
at:

Partying                                                                015
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Being a White Mage will provide many invites to random party's. It is wise
to make sure you're using your abilities to your full potential to benefit
your party. Referring to the Macro's section above can be very beneficial to
you and your party, so be sure to get use to them.

You should probably begin to party shortly after you hit 10, so when you
start getting into tougher areas, you'll have a general idea of what to do.
This section will not provide you with every helpful tip on becoming a
successfull White Mage in a party. Depending on a guide for such things is
not always good as everyone has a different feel for the game. However, here
are a few tips that you may want to take interest in that I have found
useful.

- "Die monster, die! *Goes into attack mode*"

Very bad idea. First of all, this is only really doable for the first dozen
levels or so while monsters hit you for low damage. Attacking can create
unnecessary hate which can ultimately draw more hate onto you, so it is very
recommended that you don't go attacking monsters past level 10. Don't forget
about those area of effect spells and skills that monsters do too. :P

- "Eeek! I just got hit! What should I do..?"

First of all, you should stay calm if you get hit. If you start running away
it can create problems for your party. If you have a Paladin or a Red Mage
in you party, you should establish before-hand that he is the one to heal
you if you do happen to get hit so the hate will come back unto him quicker.
Although, at lower levels, (1-10) you'll find it that you will be able to
take hits, so if you do happen to party before then, it isn't as big of a
problem yet.

- "What is hate...? I don't understand..."

"Hate" is basically how much a monster hates you. The more the monster hates
you, the more inclined it is to attack you. Hate is generated by actions you
do while a monster is attacking you or someone else. You as a White Mage
should try to keep as little hate on you as possible.

- "Yay! I just got a new Cure spell!! Should I use it right away?"

The answer is no, you shouldn't use it often right away. Keep using your
lower level Cure as your new Cure spell will be less mana efficient and can
put you and your party into tight spots.

Example:
Cure I  ->  8 MP -> Cure for 30 HP
Cure II -> 24 MP -> Cure for 78 HP

In that scenario, you would use Cure I all the time, except for when there
is a party member in low health in your party, then you would use Cure II.

- "Hey, what do these Bar- spells do?"

Bar spells are spells that increase or enhance your resistance to a certain
element or a status effect. Since the December 15th update, they have been
supposedly re-vamped, so they may be useful. Aside from that, elemental
resistance Bar spells do help, even if it's just a little. Just be sure to
cast these before battle.

- "Hey, a status effect was just inflicted on a party member!"

When a status effect is inflicted on a party member, it is usually wise to
wait until the battle subsides, then go and use a -na spell to cure him or
her. Using it in battle can have two effects. One, it creates hate and
second, it could just be re-cast onto him or her by the monster, ultimately
wasting MP.

- "Protect and Protectra...huh?"

Protect is the same as Protectra with one difference. Protectra is cast on
all party members within the area of effect. Be sure to use the "-ra" area
spells while in a party, such as Protectra and Shellra. You may need to
tell your party to gather around when you are casting it though, as not to
waste MP.

- "Slow.. Paralyze... Silence... are they really that useful?"

The answer is yes, they are very useful. Always cast them at the start of
the battle. However if you're the main healer and someone else can cast the
spell, then by all means have them cast it. You do not want unnecessary hate
which might get you killed, causing problems for your party and you.

- "Should I keep my parties health at full at all times?"

Yes and no, it depends what you're fighting truthfully. If the monster has
strong area of attack spells, then you should keep your entire party's HP
as high as possible, but it doesn't need to be full. If not, then just
heal them whenever they actually need to be healed or outside of battle.

- "Regen doesn't seem to useful..."

Of course it doesn't seem useful, it only heals small amounts when it does
heal. Although it is VERY useful as it does it repeatedly, lessening your
constant healing of the main tank. Be sure to cast it on the main tank
before battle, otherwise you create unnecessary hate.
