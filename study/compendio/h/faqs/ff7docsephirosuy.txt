===============

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                   -----|   A. Starting The Game   |-----
                        '=========================='
sstma

 ------X~~~> I. - Difficulty level
            -----------------------
When you start a new game, there are 3 different levels which are easy, normal
and hard. The differents between levels are:

  easy  - start with S AUTO-SCOPE, less damage from enemies' attack.
  normal- start with AUTO-SCOPE, normal damage from enemies' attack.
  hard  - start with no AUTO-SCOPE, more damage from enemies' attack.

* Function of AUTO-SCOPE is like auto-aim. If you had equip the scope, you can 
  see a big circle when you're aiming, the target spot will auto stick to
  the enemies whoever appear in that circle, so you no need to be too
  accurated to aim your target.

  S AUTO-SCOPE is exactly same, but it has the larger area to spot out
  the enemies.(but the size of the circle on the screen still the same.)

  Easy to say, with AUTO-SCOPE, you can shoot enemies more easier.

* Here are some experiments I did for investigate the damage from enemies'
  attack in different levels. (all taken from the soldiers at the beginning.)

   easy  - one shot reduce 11 HP
   normal- one shot reduce 44 HP
   hard  - one shot reduce 53 HP

* Another thing is the harder difficulty level you play, the more enemies you
  will encounter in game.

You can't change the difficulty level during the game unless you start another
new game.


 ------X~~~> II. Config
            ------------
After the you had selected the difficulty level, you will come to the Config
menu with:

  Vibration : ON / OFF (default is ON)
  Sound     : Stereo / Mono (default is Stereo)
  Vertical Aiming view   : Reverse / Normal (default is Reverse)
  Horizontal Aiming view : Reverse / Normal (default is Reverse)
  Vertical Camera view   : Reverse / Normal (default is Reverse)
  Horizontal Camera view : Reverse / Normal (default is Reverse)

After confirm the config setting, the game start.
* you still can change the config during the game.

You can check your experience in the "Status" mode under the "Triangle Menu",
displayed as " EXP ".

Although the EXP you gain over than the EXP for next level, but you still in
the same level, because the EXP will only be gained exaclty after you finish
the chapter.

Once you finish the chapter, you will see your chapter ended result, the first
and second pages are showing how good did you finish the chapter. Then the
"Third Page" is the EXP exchange page with two options, 
  - The first option  = use the EXP for you level, which means level up.
  - The second option = exchange the EXP to Gil, 1 EXP equal to 10 Gil

Another way you can level up is after you been defeated. You will be able
to choose whether you want to store current EXP to your total experience.

After the long CG, prepare to press your R1 button. When you just able to
control Vincent, there are three DG soldiers appear in front, and they are
probably shooting at you, no doubt, just kill them. Go the your right hand
side, take the potion and climb the ladder. Go forward until the T junction,
go left way (the end of right way got a white crate which can be destroyed for
a random item, but mostly the crate is empty). There are some enemies on the
way, just take them down. Until you reach a building at your left hand side,
get inside to the building and go down until you reach to exit, beat down the
soldiers on the way.

After the cut scene, storm in the front until the E area, a group of people
run inside and chasing by the soldiers, kill the soldiers, and don't worry
about the people, Vincent's gun won't hurt the innocent people.
Once you reached the main road, you can see a group of soldier at your left
hand side, defeat all of them. After that keep go forward until another E area
a peaple suddenly run out from the right path and chasing by the soldiers also,
kill the soldiers. Keep going forward until the end and turn left, you can see
some enemies, shoot them before they notice you. After disposed them, go inside
and save the refugee.

*NOTE: the more refugee you save, the more gil you gain in the end of chapter.

Now go back to the "T-junction" you did pass through just now. Get in the path
and stand on the blue light area. This is a MP (Mako Point) filler aura,
after you stand on it, your MP was increased. Don't forgot the take the box
beside, it's your gun enhancer. After you plug it to the gun, it will able
to use a magic shot, and this is a " Fire " spell enhancer, so you can cast 
somthing like fire ball from you gun. Press L1 to aim and press one more time
to shoot, you still can use normal shooting by pressing R1 button.

Finish the arrangment go forward to trigger a cut scene. Then go to the laser
gate and press circle, you need a Card Key for open this gate. Turn back and
wait a while, two soldiers will spawn form the path and the door at the side,
one of them has the Card Key (the one came from the door)kill them and get
the Card and open the laser gate.

Just only one way to go in this section, so just follow to road. Until the
junction, you will see some people escape from the shooting of a aeroplane.
Well, I can't do anything for this, but fortunately nobody dies here.
After this, you can see another Mako Point in front, go there and fill some MP.
If your MP bar already reached the yellow, you can use the limit break. To
perform the limit break, simply press L1 and R1 together (default setting).

There is another cut scene after you pass through the Mako Point, a girl caught
by a beast. When you reach that area, the beast has bring the child into a
machine crate. Now your mission is save the child out from the crate. Go to
the machine crate which trapped the child, press circle to open the door.
While waiting the door completly open, some enemies are spawnning from all
direction, some of them are hiding in the building, they'll shoot you through
the second floor window, and also some soldiers and beasts at the ground floor.
No need to worry about the child, as long as you defeat all enemies. Take the
item behind the machine crate, then keep going forward to the next area.

Now go to the gate with laser in the first junction and press circle, knowing
as you need another Card Key for this laser gate. Go back to the main road and
reach to the second juction to trigger a event. After the cut scene, shoot
down all the soldiers to save the refugee. Then get into the third juntion for
the Card Key, halfway got a Mako Point. Prepare to fight with a group of
soldiers. Shoot the explosive barrel to finish them faster, but they are quite
easy to beat also. The Card Key is located near the burning area, take it and
return to the main road. Turn to the Western section, and now you will see
a few refugees attacking by the soldiers from other side and blocking by the
fire, you can't cross there, so you need to shoot down all of them to save
the refugees.

After this, go back to the laser gate, use the Card Key to open the gate and
go inside. Go up the stair and go down to other side, and there are few groups
of enemies will appear. In this narrow place, better kill all the enemies,
and one of them appear in the last group before you go out will drop a
"Long Barrel" for your gun after you kill him. The Long Barrel allow you
to damage to the enemies from further distance, but you move slow when
you're aiming. Take the items around the staircase, after this go outside.


BOSS FIGHT : ÉhÉâÉSÉìÉtÉâÉCÉÑÅ[ (Dragon Flyer)

It's like an aeroplane mixed with helicopter. It will attack you by the
machine gun or rocket launcher, and the rocket is always homing to you. Try
use jump to evade the rocket when it's close, if you duck, the explosion
might still hurt you althought you successfully evaded to shot. But don't
worry, it doesn't deal much damage. About the machine gun attack, you can just
keep runing or hide behind the boxes at the corner, it doesn't deal much damage
too.

This boss always flying in the air, and sometimes the building might blocking
you from shoot it, so don't waste the chances when you can hit it. Don't forgot
to plug the Long Barrel on your gun. Use the magic shot could hurt it more, but
try don't use it when the plane is getting far, the shot will easily miss.

After it's several rounds rotating, the plane (boss) will release some
soldiers to attack you, finish off the soldiers before continue targeting on
the boss.

             ---------------------

After defeating the boss fight, you will come to a place looks like office
room. Now take the item behind the table at your left, it is a Phoenix Down,
like the other Final Fantasy also, it can revive from KO after you use it.
Enter all the rooms to get some gil and item. 

Inside the first room at you right side can find a first " Shop Machine "
in the game, you can buy, sell your inventory items or accessories here,
also you can spend some gil to tune up your weapon.
The shop menu options are: BUY, SELL, TUNE, from left to right.
The items are selling in this Shop Machine:
-Potion (100 gil),
-Phoenix Down (1000 gil)
-ÉnÉìÉhÉJÉìÇÃú[ (10 gil)  *the bullet for your current gun

Now go up the end and take the " Short barrel " beside the stair. Short Barrel
is suitable for shooting the closer enemies, just as oppose with Long Barrel.
Go up throw the staircase to trigger the cut scene. After it, kill the
solider whoever comes out from the fallen wall, except the two DG elites that
you can't shoot them.

After another cut scene, you are back to the outside. The DG soliders are
unlimited spawning before you reach door at the South-East area. You can kill
some of them before go to that door for getting some experiences. Once you
reach the South-East area, the WRO force appear to help. Now you have to go to
the Eastern section in the city, here is nothing to do anymore other then take
the two Mako Point and destroy the crates around to getting some items. Leave
this area throw the opened door. Just go forward until the fire area, there is
another cut scene here, if you don't skip this scene, you will be asking to
choose from four options, the first option is something like the Shop Machine,
you can take the HP or MP recovery items for free, maximum five for each. But
you can't tune you weapons here. The second and third option are telling you
some infomations only. The last option is MOVE!

Remember to take the Griffon behind the huge boxes on your left side before
you leave here, it's a machine gun. Take also the bullets for it beside.
Now go until the junction, go front or left (North area) way to kill all the DG
force to save the people and WRO force as well. Then advance to the other way,
help WRO force to defeat all the enemies. Destroy the crates in the right

of the house. Go to the left way laser gate before the right way, open the
laser gate you can take 500 gil and another Card Key, now only go to the laser
gate at the right way.

*NOTE : the more WRO force alive, the more gil you gain in the end of the
        chapter, same like the refugees.

Now just follow the road, some enemies spawn in the halfway, some of them from
the rooftop, easily take them down. A Mako Point and a bag of bullet are on the
building's ground at you right side, jump to there to take them if you want.
Continue the road until reach the Eastern section.

to evade them when they're closed.

When begins the battle, the boss will shoot you by the machine gun, you can
run around of use the L3 + square button to dodge. Plug the Long Barrel to
shoot it is better. At first, keep shooting its leg until it likes kneel down,
now you can see a shining spot at the top part, shoot this spot as many as you
can, it was the weakness of the boss, you can kill it before it's recovered. If

After a while, Vincent will climb out side, standing on the top of the lorry.
Continue to shoot the beasts before they jump to you, but now you're using
your own guns. The beasts will always come in front at the beginning, slowly
they will move to the side, and the final group will jump from the back.

After successfully past the beasts, you're locating in a very empty place.

direction. Becareful they come behind, they probably will knock you down,
so don't always still. They knocked you down, use R3 to view where are their
current location before you wake up.

Their movement are quite fast, so your magic shot is easily miss from
far, shoot them with normal shot from far, shoot them with the magic shot when
close to them. Prepare some potions for safety, but their damage aren't that
high, still consider an easy boss fight.

This place has many paths and junctions, is a bit confused people. Explore
the paths to get some items, also some beasts are hiding there. If you've no
interest, just go the North section. Once you reach the central North, you
found a injured WRO soldier, get the Card Key after the scene. Now go back
to South-West area where you came from. Use the Card Key open the laser gate
in the path, advance to next area.

A new weapon 'Hydra' is near the counter with a new scope, Sniper Scope. This
gun is actually a rifle type weapon, of cause it use the rifle bullet, good for
long distance targets. As the scope is a Snipe-Scope, if you're using this for
you gun, once you press R3 to zoom in, the view will become a scope in cross
bar mode, exactly like the sniper view.

After come out from that room, some soldiers will shoot you from very far,
use you new gun to kill them. When you reach the Southern part, will
see a kid running in front, follow him until he enter the room. Inside the

gate, now go back to the room where you get the Card Key just now. The room
located in the North-East area, find your map in the coordinate J-11, that's
it. After go inside that room, look around your right hand side, there is a
weapon just beside the door, it's named Toy Gun. Now it's still weak, you only

You come up from S, defeat the DG soldiers on the bridge, one of them with
cannon if you didn't kill him at downstair. Go in the door beside for some
items and the shop machine. Here is no Card key the open the laser gate, just
get in the other door to pass the laser gate, a Mako Point before go out.
Advance to next floor.

3rd floor: Defeat all enemies in this floor, remember don't shoot the
explosive barrel, otherwise you will kill the WRO member also. Recommend to
unplug the Auto-Scope before shoot to them, because the Auto-Scope might auto
spot to the barrel although you aim at the soldiers. The last soldier will
drop you a Card key, take it to open the laser gate.

4th floor: Head to the elevator, kill the soldier will drop you an accessory.
The other soldier is going down by the elevator, now back to 3rd floor, get
in the elevator and operate it back to 4th floor. Go to the other side and
enter the door. Becareful the machine gun on the opposite corridor, when you
come back from 3rd floor, a soldier will use it to shoot you, just shoot the
barrel to kill him if you want.

After the cut scene, you can see the time is counting down, don't worry, follow
the only way in the passage. You need to fight with some enemies in the passage
and also the soldier with cannon, better shoot him with you magic shot to kill
him faster, because in the narrow passage is hard to dodge the cannon, so don't
play around. On the slope going to higher place, somebody will push down the
explosive barrel, jump over the barrels before they hit you. Until the end,
Cait Sith and Reeve appear in the cut scene. After this, head back to where you
come from.

When you reach outside, you will see Arul in the scene. Now go to the Ground
floor through the elevator, enter the door which Arul go in just now. Kill all
enemies to get another gun enhancer and the Card Key as well, perform your
melee attack in suitable situation. The room before to the final hall, you can
get a Mako Point and a shop machine before the boss fight.


BOSS FIGHT : Shelke the Transparent

Keep pressing X button to get the initiative attacks at the beginning, if you
don't do so you must run or dodge, otherwise you probebly will get hits. Her
speed is quite fast, use your melee combo attack when she comes close, you can
stun her or knock her away. Use your gun when she was far from you. She might
cast protect to herself, if she does so, just wait until she stop casting it.
When she comes to you again, do the same melee attack. Also if you use the
limit break, the melee attack could hurt her more.

After the battle, back to the passage trigger a cut scene.


BOSS FIGHT : ëìÇ´ÉAÉXÅ[Éã (Azul)

His move is very slow, suggest to fight him from far. First of all, run to the
left or right corner, then shoot the explosive barrels behind him before he
go away. Keep shooting him when he isn't close to the next barrels, dodge his
cannon as well. Once you see he puts up his huge gun, prepare to jump, the
attack he does couldn't be dodged except jumping, it's like a wave. When he
close to other barrels, shoot the them cause a large damage to him, is a quite
win if all the explosions hurt him.

CHAPTER 4 END



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     ----------|   CHAPTER 5   |----------
                               '==============='
wtc05

This chapter is start in the sewel after the scene. You now have to reach the
South-West area, and here is only one way to go, just run forward. A new enemy
appear in the cut scene, kill all of them. This enemy looks like turtle,
green colour, and their name is called Sahagin, an enemies in FF-VII. Some
of them know to shoot you from far, but mostly here are using melee attack in
the short distance. Go until the laser gate, and some items are located in the
corner beside. The second corner at the left could found Phoenix Down, but will
trigger out an enemy. After this, climb up the ladder at right side, then jump
down to other side, take the Mako Point as well before jump down. A few enemies
jump down to fight with you, kill all them to get the Card Key, open the
laser gate and continue to South-West area.

After reached there, now you need to go Eastern area in this section
(you can read from the map). After pass through the narrow path, you will see
some enemies are walking around, shoot the explosive barrel for killing them
easily before they noticed you. On the way you will see a crate in the broken
gate canal at you left hand side, that is an enemy hiding inside the crate,
destroy the crate and kill it if you want. Go forward and turn right in front,
another group of enemy walking around, once you shoot one of them, the other
will noticed you, kill them. A Hi-potion is located inside the big water hole,
and some bullets on the bridge behind. Continue until the end of the route,
before enter to the Eastern, jump to the other side opposited there to get
a new material. This new accessory is enhance your gun to cast " Bolt " in the
shot, make sure don't miss it.

Now you have to go to the North-East area in this section. An enemy at the
right side after you go out, it's blocking by the gate, but it will shoot you,
kill this anoying monster. Keep going until reach the laser gate, one of the
enemies spawned in front the gate has the Card Key, here is the optional part,
if you enter the laser gate you can get some bullet, but forced to fight with
several enemies, defeat them will get another Card Key, you can enter the
inner part for 2,500 gil. After this climb the ladder opposite the laser gate
area, take the Mako Point then go inside until the switch, operate it. After
that, jump down and operate another switch, and also some enemies are around
here. Continue to the North-East area, then climb the ladder to upstiar.

Finally come out from sewel. Some DG soldiers are around here, kill them as
well as those are in the upstair. Go to the half opened store room at the
left corner in front, duck or roll in there, there are some gils and an 
accessory inside. After that just leave the store room, the enemies are
unlimited spawning. Now go to the elevator, wait until it's open then enter
it to go first floor. You can actually skip the first floor if you don't need
the Mako Point and a Shop Machine (you have to go down the staircase for the
Shop Machine).

In second floor, enter the only bridge through the door, take the Mako Point
and bullets as well. I strongly recommend you to plug the "Medium Barrel" on
the gun you going to use, for this part, the DG soldiers will come out to shoot
you at the left and right corridor.The first wave of enemies will appear at
the left side first, then another side. The second wave has one soldier with
cannon, better kill him first when he was appeared. After this better enter
the following door and reach to the elevator trigger the cut scene.

Surprise! Now you play as Cait Sith, he has no weapon and his melee attack
is very weak also, means you need to run away from the fight. When begin, just
turn to the right side, jump over the several huge pipes until see a DG
soldier. Don't bother to kill the soldier, run pass him and jump out bravely as
far as you can. You probably reach to the other platform, if you drop in the
bottom floor never mind, just climb up the platform by the ladder. Now you can
see two DG soldiers left and right, no doubts, don't spend times to kill them,
run pass them to the ladder area to trigger the scene that Cait Sith noticed
a hole at the bottom which can let him leave here.

After that, jump to downstair, but this time don't jump far because the
DG soldiers in downstair might noticed you. Reached the bottom you can see the
soldier in front of you now, ignore him and go to your left corner will see
a fallen explosive barrel, push it to kill the soldier in front. Then follow
the way to the other corner, you can see another fallen barrel, do the same
thing as just now, push it to kill the soldier in front. Now has two lesser
anoying soldiers, and just ignore the rest of them even they have noticed you.
And the hole you need to go is blocking by the robots in the central, you have
to find other side, go to the corner where you kill the second soldier by the
explosive barrel, jump up to the boxes and then descend to other side where
is behind the robots, finally reached the hole.

Cait Sith came to other side through the hole. Go down the stair, just need to
keep going, run pass all the soldiers. After the second circle platfrom, turn
right in the middle of the stair, go inside and watch the cut scene.

Now back to Vincent. Enter the door in front and follow with the second door.
After the scene, you have to find all " Omega Report ", they're totally four
reports, and you're having one of them now. You can found some items in the
room at left side and the left room in second hall as well. Enter the door
at the right in front, and following the door at left. Now you're in a corridor
with many rooms, the passage at left side (South-East) is the destination you
need to go, but don't go first. Search the room in front you for Mako Point,
then go to the two connected rooms in the Western area, there are some items
on the table and an " Omega Report " in the next room, search the right corner,
the Omega Report is on the ground. Also you will facing some DG soldiers, and
some of them in the room also.

The more Omega Reports you get, the more gils you gain in the end of chapter.

Go to the passage in South-East, now already come to a place like cave.
Destroy the crate beside for a Phoenix Down, if you enter the room at the left,
you can fight with a swordman inside, kill him for 1,000 gils, he will comes
out from the coffin. But if you skip this room, you still encouter this
enemy in front. Keep going until you found the laser gate area.

You need to destroy all Land Mine within the time limit, the number of mines
you destroyed will affect the gils you gain in the end of the chapter, same
as the Omega Report.

The Land Mine will only appear when you're close to it, when it's appeared,
move back a few step then shoot it, because the explosion could hurt you if
you're close to it. Also you can hear something like clock sound when you're
closing to the mine.

After this, take the Card Key to unlock the laser gate. Go push the switch to
activate the machine, stand on the plate then jump to opposite area, a Mako
Point and a beast (Normal or above difficculty mode) are under the plate, also
a soldier will come in front when you close to the opposite area. Continue the
passage, take down the DG soldiers on the way. A Mako Point, some items and a
Shop Machine are inside the room at the left. Through this room, you can also
can return to the area where you get the first Omega Report in the cut scene,
but it's needless to back there. Go until the round tower and follow the circle
staircase to go upper level.

If you're FF-VII fans, is the location you pass just now looks familiar?
Yes, this is Shinra Mansion, don't you figured out?

Now you have to back to the main hall, becareful the bombs dropped by the
robot, jump over the bombs. Take the Mako Point then head back to the previous
room.

When you're through the room before reach the main hall, you will see a Shop
Machine that isn't here just now appear beside the door. Use it if you want,
upgrade your guns or accessories for the boss fight just few second soon,
if you still have gils.


BOSS FIGHT : Black Widow

It could knock you down easily when you're closed with it, or you can use limit
break to fight with it by using melee attack, prepare some potions as well.
But this isn't the good way.

Recommend fight it at the upstair, fight with it in long distance. When it's
gun is shining, means it's prepare to shoot the laser, keep running around to
evade it easily. Shoot it from the direction where it's not looking at, when
it's looking at you, it will use the machine gun attack, so just run to other
side before it shoots you. The machine gun attack doesn't deal much damage,
worry about the laser.

Sometimes the boss will climb to the ceiling, when it's climbing, shoot it
as much as you can, plug the most suitable barrel to your gun depends to the
distance it goes. Once it's stop, pay attention to the move it could perform
while shooting it. It has another move is throw you a heap of bombs, but the
bombs fall slow, can be evaded easily, and the bombs will explode after several
seconds it touched the ground.

If you deal a large damage to it when it's on the wall or ceiling, it will
be knock down to the ground, now shoot the light part on its body, it is the
weakness, don't waste the good chance.

Vincent comes out from the lorry after a few scenes. Now you have to fight
two robots. Plug your gun with long or medium barrel, fight with them in
a long distance. When the robot is stop moving, that's mean it's going to shoot
you with the rocket, the rocket is quite slow, is very easy to be dodged.
Defeat the third robot after the first and second robot were dead. Take the
Card key and open the laser gate, take the Mako Point around the laser gate as
well.

Go along the only way in the valley until the cave, kill the beasts came
from the mountain. There is a new enemy appears here, it's a huge bird
(chocobo?), attack in the short distance but still a weak enemy, probably
they will run away. Take the Mako Point before enter to the cave. Another new
enemy appears inside the cave, huge BUGs, defeat them following the
DG soldiers. Suprising the huge bug will also attack DG soldiers although both
of them were your enemies.

Until the precipice, better kill the soldier before jump down. Once you down
to the bottom, a swarm of bugs will spawn from the mountain, trigger them to
the explosive barrels area, shoot the barrel to kill a bunch of them at once.
Remember the bugs and the soldiers would attack each other also. Some crates
were located in the camp, you can get some gil and items from the crates, one
of the crate hiding a bug. Also a Shop Machine was here.

After reaching to the base, you've been given a mission to take down the all
the DG soldiers and following with another mission which is to destroy all
enemies' airship. Using your own gun isn't a good idea, so faster go in the
front to the little left area, operate that heavy machine gun and use it to
shoot down the airships, they are totally 15 planes, would come in front or
behind, the few at last will come in two or three together.

After the 15 aeroplanes, aim to the area where you came, the last airship
probably would fall on there, then few soldiers with big blade will come from
the airship after it's exploded. Kill all of them for the Card Key, you can
still using the heavy machine gun for this job. Afterwards, open the laser
gate in the North, before that destroy the crate and take the hidden Mako
Point.

Inside the base could found a Mako Point and Shop Machine. Out from here to
face with many soldiers and beasts, some are fighting with WRO forces in
the front, save the WRO as well. Enter the door at the left front, some
DG soldiers are inside, if you decide to shoot the explosive barrel, you
probably would kill the WRO soldier also. After take care of them, leave here
will face with many soldiers and beasts again. Kill them for the Card Key,
go in to underground after open the laser gate. This place has many soldiers
also, some of them shoot you from the top level. There are some items and gils
in the front right corner, as well as Mako Point. After this, run up the stair.


BOSS FIGHT : Black Widow II

It's like the one you fought in the Shinra Mansion before, but now added some
soldiers around, one of the soldier around the boss will drop a gun enhancer
after you kill her, it's enhance your accurate for long distance.

For this boss, I strongly recommend you to shoot it from the further location.
Take the Mako Point at the left corner. If you fight from far, the boss would
away shoot you with the laser which is very easy to evade, but quite powerful.
Keep running around and shoot it, or simply go to the bridge on the rooftop,
operate the machine gun defeat it easily.

If the boss shoot you with rocket, you can simply use the L3+square technique
to dodge it, or shoot the rocket directly before it comes close. Sometimes
it will use its machine gun also, you can run around to evade it, but is very
small damage, don't worry about it.

After defeated the boss, enter the main entrance.

Once you open the main door, you will see the WRO fight with the DG forces
again, kill all DG soldiers, take the item around and the Mako Point. Go to
the X area in the North-East.

Now keep going and will trigger a scene, Azul already transformed into
behemoth from, looks terrible, but you no need to fight him now.

You now have to reach the N area. There is a Mega potion and Hi potion in this
section, as well as Mako Point. Defeat all DG soldiers in the narrow passages,
few of them have cannon. You can shoot them from far, so that you could dodge
the cannon shot easily, if you have very much MP, shoot a fire shot to kill
them in once or maybe two.

After this section is something like "train park" place. Search the right
central area for Mako Point and left central area for 2,000 gils. Reach the
Northern area.


BOSS FIGHT : Shrikes

Also a group of soldiers, but is quite annoy because they always flying in the
air. Recommended use your rifle gun (ÉqÉhÉâ) with long barrel for this battle.

At the beginning you probably can see a few coming to you, choose one of them
and shoot him as much as possible. If they're shooting at you, keep running
around, try use the train as you shield if possible. Counter attack when they
stop shooting at you. Keep shoot at one target before they gone far, kill them
one by one, the final victory is yours.

CHAPTER 8 PART 1/2 END


Follow WRO soldiers to the front until reach the laser gate, then kill all
DG soldiers in the room at left side for the Card Key, inside that room can
found a Hi-potion which hiding behind the boxes. After cross the laser gate,
some DG soldiers coming in front, you can see lot of explosive barrel here,
shoot them to kill the DG soldiers faster. Run pass the train to the other
side, follow the road to North-East, item beside the fallen train on the way.
After pass the fallen train, go use the big machine gun in front and shoot
down all DG soldiers, then take the Card Key to open the following laser gate.

Take the Mako Point in the narrow passage, destroy the crate to get some gils,
then climb up the ladder to start a mission. There is something like iron club,
but with the rotor, when it touch you, it will explode. Now you have to cross
over the laser while evading the clubs here, don't worry the laser, they don't
deal damage, focus on the clubs.

After that, go up the stair, help WRO forces to defeat DG soldiers again, you
can shoot the barrel near the DG soldiers, mostly can kill all of them. After
that, keep going until the next mission. Now plug the Blizzard Materia on your
gun and make sure you have enough MP to use it. If not, use Ether to fill up
soe MP. Follow the passage, when close to the stairs, a robot suddenly pop out
in front, you can just run pass it if you want, but if you kill it you will get
better result in the end of chapter. As I mention just now, shoot it with your
Blizzard shot to kill it instantly.

Go up stair found a Shop Machine, after that turn right, and now you're at the
central of a long passage. From here, the end of your left hand side is a
puzzle room, your right hand side is to the next area. Lets talk about right
side first, when you come out, a soldier shooting at you with the heavy
machine gun, use your long range weapon or magic shot the take him down, an
item beside the machine gun. If you want to have fun with the machine gun,
operate it and aim to the direction where you came from, it will trigger a
group of DG soldiers come to attack you. If you don't operate the machine gun,
the soldiers won't come out.

About the room at the other side, inside there was blocking by many laser, you
need to open them one by one to get some items, if you're not interesting with
two bag of 1,000 gils and a Hi-potion, no need to vistt this room. For this
room, you have to shoot the black ball inside to open the laser gate.
Following is the way to solve this little puzzle room.

Reference map:

NOTE: this map is not follow the direction in the actual map.

     |   S       |----------------------

S is where you come in.
-First of all, go to x1 shoot the black ball at 1, solved L1 laser.
-Go to x2 shoot the black ball at 2, solved L2 laser.
-Now jump up the box to x3, shoot the black ball at 3, solved L3 laser.
-Jump down to the next area from x3, shoot the black ball at 4 which hiding
 beside the box, solved L4 laser.
-Lastly go to x5 shoot the black ball at 5, solved L5 laser.

(While shoot the black ball at 4, don't stay too close with it, the explosion
 could hurt you.)

After all, go back to the machine gun in the other side of the passage, climb
the up ladder behind, a DG soldier will pop out from the room at the right
side. If you go to the half opened door with laser in front, you will get a
mission, if you success this mission you can get some good items as well as
G-file.

The mission is protect the WRO forces until they successfully unlock all locks.
Once the mission start, duck and aim to the corner where the WRO soldier
is unlocking the locks, they are 40 locks totally. When one of them is
unloacking, the DG soldier will comes to attack him/her, is better use
your long range weapon to shoot down the DG soldier. If he/she get killed, the
second WRO soldier will goes there continue the unlocking process, and follow
by the third. If all three WRO soldiers were died, you can't get in that area
anymore. After success the mission, go inside the passage, a Mako Point at the
corner, and some DG soldiers are shooting you from the stair. After defeated
them, go up the stair and climb up the ladder to get some bullets, X-potion
as well as G-file.

NOTE: Obtain three G-files for the extra ending, if you don't want to watch
      the extra ending, you can just leave it.


Now back to the room you pass through just now, enter the room and kill all
enemies inside, one of them has Card Key. Open the laser gate and get in to
the elevator, remember you need to push the button beside the elevator.

When come out from elevator, the WRO forces are fighting with DG forces, kill
the DG forces. In front has a robot pops out and dash to you again, like the
one you encountered before, you can actually run pass it, but the gils you
gain in the end of chapter will slightly decrease. After that follow the only
way here, kill all the small robots come from the wall, then go forward, push
the switch in the elevator to active it.

When come out in other floor, some enemies are coming from very far in the
front, you can actually use your rifle (ÉqÉhÉâ) to kill them before they
can attack you. Go forward and kill the small robots on the way, a Mako Point
on your left hand side when reached the junction. A Shop Machine opposite
the left door, better maximize your recovery items here before the boss in next
door. Enter the door, take the items around before going to the front.


BOSS FIGHT : éÈÇÃÉçÉbÉ\ÉoÅ[ÉXÉg (Red Rosso)

You must have at least some potions, Hi-potions as well as Mega-potions for
this battle, even you're playing in easy mode also need some potions for
safety.

You need to plug one of your weapon with long barrel, medium barrel and short
barrel, this boss always run around, so you have to always change the weapon
in the suitable distance. If you haven't familiar with changing weapons, just
plug the medium weapon, I noticed the boss more likely attack you from the
medium range and short range, so when the boss comes close, try dodge the
her attack, shoot her when she goes to a distance.

Her movement is fast, try to track her when she runs away. Keep shooting her
in a distance, she could easy to knock you down when closing, so I don't
recommend to fight in short distance. And seen she likes to run, use your
Ice shot isn't a bad idea.

When she left 3/4 HP, her moves have changed, she will throw you the fire
blade and it is homing at you, always comes with double, you must have a right
time only can dodge it perfectly, or try running in the curve line, this could
works well also. Another way is run close to the boxes, poles around, they
could become you shields, but if you just doing so, the boss will just keep
doing the same thing also, you must shoot her to break her from throwing
the fire blade, find a right time to shoot at her.

While her HP getting lesser, she will perform her melee attack more rusher,
once you see she's running to you in front, then you should running to back
for dodge her melee attack. But remember, the last kick of her melee attack
could hit you although you're still running, so try run in curve line when
she performing the last kick. If you successfully dodged all her melee attack,
now is the chance to counter back. When she knocked you down, remember to press
square or circle button to recover (recommend circle), if you fail to
recover from fall, you would get hurt by her following attack.

Her machine gun shot doesn't deal much damage, when she's using the machine
gun, you can use this chance to shoot her, is like you're sacrifice some HP
to hurt her. She has another spell is like a small wave, storm to you on the
floor, this wave is quite fast, you can dodge it by either jump or run.
If you use limit break, your Gallian shot could be useful also, but you must
be accurative, if not, better save you MP to use the Ice shot.

face on the way, but they're not that hard to beat, also take the items around.

faster shut the door by pushing the switch beside to blocking the bugs come
inside, they're unlimited spawning. Take the Mako Point before enter to final
room.


BOSS FIGHT : ÉuÉâÉbÉNÅEÉEÉBÉhTW

The boss that you fough in Shinra Mansion, but now you need to fight two 
together. Is a very easy battle, one will stick at the ceiling and throw the
bombs, another is shooting you on the ground.

Same, shoot them from far. Don't bother with the one at the ceiling first,
kill the other one which would shoot you by the laser, but it's very easy to
dodge, just run around when you see the shinning from its launcher. Machine
gun attack doesn't deal much damage. After that, shoot the remaining one at
the ceiling until it's die.

Defeated them enter the elevator and press the switch. Come to the other level
through the elevator, but you only can get the map later.

rotor clubs at the elevator like just now. They're 99 all together with the
clubs coming out in the elevator before.

Mako Point at the corner, then enter the following door. Defeat the cannon
soldier in the second hall, then go through the passage. Until you see the
small robot appears in the passage, there is the place you might be surrounding
by a group of robots and beasts, better use your fire shot to kill them group
by group in that narrow passage.

Pass the passage come to a square room, some items are in the four corners
here. Cross the following bridge watch the scene.


BOSS FIGHT : ëìÇ´ÉAÉXÅ[Éã ÉCÅ[ÉNÉCÉbÉu2 (Azul)

He's easy to be defeated, not much changes from chapter 4, but now has no
explosive barrels anymore.

You're aiming at him when the battle start, shoot him one or twice if you want,
but you would get shot by his machine gun. When he puts up his huge gun, ready
to jump the wave. Revolve around the huge pole in the central, his machine gun
couldn't shoot through the pole. When he stop shooting, counter him with your
gun, remember to plug the suitable barrel. Sometimes he will stupidly run to
you and perform a kick, don't try to run pass him, just let him chase from your
back, turn the camera looking at him, after his missed the kick, counter him.


BOSS FIGHT : Arch Azul

Don't scared by his big body, you can beat him easily. Surprising this big boy
weaks against Ice, so plug your Ice material to the gun, forget about other
things, only Ice can hurt him more. There is two easy ways to beat him.

Here is this safer way, but you need times and some items to restore your MP.
By using this tactic, you can defeat him even without getting a hit also.
See the huge pole in the central? Revolve around the pole, the boss will
chases you, but because of his big body, he's slower than you while running
around the pole, remember to stay close with the pole while revolving. Turn
you camera view to look at him, when you get further from him, shoot him with
your Ice shot, then keep running and repeat. Normally you don't have enough MP
to defeat him by only using Ice shot, so just use some items such as Ether to
refill you MP.

Another way is use your limit break, change into Galian Beast then use melee
attack to fight him. Don't bother to dodge his attacks, just keep hitting him.
His smack could knock you down, so keep pressing circle before fallen to
ground, then run to him and hit, repeat until defeated him. For safety, you
better prepare some potions, ready to use them when your HP is low.

Remember the metal crates around each hiding a Mako Point, but you have to lure
the boss to destroy it before you can obtain the MP. For the NTSC/UC version,
the boss seem to be more HP or Defend, means you deal leser damage compare to
Japanese version. But since you can control and move better than Japanese
version, so just lure him to destroy the crates without getting damage isn't
a big problem.

Now in the upper level, here is a Mako Point and Shop Machine. All you need to
do is take the Card Key in lower level. Go through the L1, L2 and then take L3
ladder down to the lower lever. Now go and destroy all crates here, the crates
are hiding items, gils, enemy and also the Card Key randomly. Normally the Card
Key will appear in the last crate that you destroyed. After getting the Card
Key, back to upper lever, some soldiers will shoot you from the opposite
building. Open the laser, go to the J area and jump down, turn to East enter

Mako Point and found a Shop Machine, then go out through the door in front.

Now get in the motor cart, a mission given. While moving to destination, kill
whoever appears, they're 10 totally, and the last one is a Dragon Flyer,
an aeroplane you fough in chapter 1. Just kill them all if you can, the
Dragon Flyer is much more durable than the one in chapter 1. After came out
from the motor cart, turn to right side and enter to that door. Jump to the
bottom then go South advance to next section.

There is a crate at the left broken road, a crate and a Shop Machine in front,
and now you need to cross the passage at right side to go the Northern area.
They're many soldiers in the passage, but you must cross there, just defeat
all of them and pay attention on the soldiers with protect spell, you can
kill them by using magic or melee attack, keep this in mind. Run down the
stair, kill the soldier for the Card Key, 2,000 gils at the broken stair
behind.

Now go down to the rooftop through the broken passage, kill the annoying
enemies shooting at you from other buildings. Before leave the rooftop, turn
back and search the right corner under the staircase you went down just now,

      the extra ending, you can just leave it.


Go to the stair at left side, the crate beside hiding a Mako Point. Now if you
go down to take the Mako Point and weapon, you will be locked here, and you
need to take down all the beasts spawning here for the Card Key to unlock the
laser gate. Now back to the stair, go up turn to right side, take the Card Key
on the box, then use it for the next laser gate. When near the gate, some DG
soldiers will come out at the rooftop and shoot you, two cannon soldiers will
pop out beside the gate.

After that, turn left and jump down, before this, you can found a Shop Machine
over the wall at right side. Now go until you reach the area where would be

Card Key. After pass this area, reach to the water area, just go up the stair
to get an Elixir (fully restore your HP & MP), and also some items, gil around
the water area here, but you have to fight with some enemies.

After that go to the right corner, go up the stair you will see three Mako
Points in the central of the bridge, for the NTSC/UC version, there's no even
a Mako Point on the bridge, however you can find a Limit Breaker indead of
three Mako Point. You can also a Shop Machine on the right before moving onto
the bridge. You will be blocking in the bridge when you go through, and you
need to kill all enemies for the Card Key. Take the three Mako Points whenever
you want, try use middle barrel for this battle, if you're good accuracy,
nobody can get close to you, just becareful the shooting person. If you got
the Blow/Blast Machine Gun before, it was quite useful for this battle. After
all, obatain the Card Key and use it to the laser gate, get pass the bridge
watch a scene.

You can see a Shop Machine in front of you, and some bullet beside it, also
bullets on the staircase while you're going up. Reached upstair will blocking

after finish off the soldier, go up the stair.

When get in to the building you will see many black bombs are blocking the

will appear to shoot you at the bottom, becareful the connon soldier. Take the
Card Key and open the laser gate. Some soldiers will jump up, just kill them
easily, becareful the rotor clubs in the central of the this building, they
will come to you and explode themself while you crossing the following
passage. Take the Card Key to open the laser gate in front, evade or jump over
the barrels throwing inside, open the laser gate with the following Card Key.

Go down the stair, some DG soldiers will shoot you from the opposite building,
and a Shop Machine is in the passage. When come to the street, many soldiers
are waiting for you, one of them here is using the heavy machine gun. You must
kill all of them, then three more soldiers will appear again, kill them to get
the Card Key. You can open both laser gate with you only Card Key in once.

side, fight with some swordmans and a big blade soldier in the small room, get
the Card Key to open the laser gate, climb up the inner ladder, get in the
door to get the mission. You need to defeat 100 enemies in the hall here, if
you want to quit this mission, just leave the hall anytime, but once you left,
you can't return anymore. Enemies are the soldiers you fough before. If you
want to complete the mission, better don't just stand near the entrance,
because you might been knocked out from the hall. The enemies will appear from
everyway, but sometimes they would stop coming out, then you should run around
to trigger them out. A Mako Point is under the tank at the left in front.

You will get ã‡ÇÃÉÇÅ[ÉOÉäêlå` (Golden Moggle) if you success this mission,

BOSS FIGHT : Nero the Sable

Don't fight him nearly, always keep further from him can hit him easily.
The rocks around could become your shield, run behind the rock when he's
shooting at you, but this couldn't works well when he jumps to the air, so keep
running when he flying in the air, is better run in a curve line. Once he stop
shooting, don't waste the chance to perform a counterattack, remember plug
you gun with the suitable barrel first, you can stun him easily.

When he spreads to three bodies even easy, you can damage him when you
hurt anyone of them. Normally all of them will perform the same move in the
same time. If they shoot you, you can still hide behind the rock as your
shield although now they've three guns now, the rock could blocks all of them.
Once they stop, counterattack. When he spining to you, keep running to evade
it, shoot him when he's stop the move.

At the beginning of this area, take the Mako Point and items. Now you need to
reach N, to next area, on the way you have to face some protect spell soldiers,
so always prepare some item to fill up your MP, because sometimea you can't
always stay close combat with them.

After this area, go down the stair until you reach to the door, a Mako Point at
left side after you pass the first stair. Jump down from the ladder at left
side, take the item at right side, then go to the bottom. Turn right and go
through the passage, jump over the pipe to fight with the soldiers with
protection. The laser gate will block you when you reached to corner, so kill
the bugs here to get the Card Key. A mega-potion on the small platfrom, you
can climb up through the ladder at the other side, just jump to bottom and
climb back there from the other ladder around here.

After that, jump down the empty area in the front, pick up some 100 gils bags
and Mako Point here. Kill all bugs here for the Card Key to open the laser gate
which blocking you way. After that, just run down the stair until the next door
in front, go through it and the following door, watch a cut scene.

Now some you've a mission which to kill the soldiers shooting at you from
the central tower, just kill them if you want. The good idea is shoot down the
explosive barrels on top of them and then shoot it to explode the soldiers,
becareful the soldiers with cannon, do remember each cannon can knock you down.
Get in the door to next area.

Another mission given, you need to kill all the flying monster here. There is
a machine gun at downstair, if you don't want to use it, you can just use your
own weapon the take them down. Run down the stair, a Mako Point at the left
side, reach to the bottom and enter the door. A Shop Machine is here before
you go out from the following door.

Now you are here, after the scene you will be blocking by the laser gate with
a protection soldier in the V area, this soldier has more HP then other, better
use your strongest magic to kill him faster. Another soldier is pushing out the
heavy machine gun fron N while you're fighting with the soldier in V, better
kill him before he operate the heavy machine gun, normally 2-3 Ice shots are
enough the finish off him. Go to N after defeated them.

Once you open the door, the DG soldiers are shooting you, they're all with
protect spell also, chase them and use melee attacks or just shoot them with
your magic shot. A Mako Point in front, take it and then enter the door. Some
soldiers are shooting from top, but if you don't cross the passage, they
couldn't hurt you, take them down with you magic shot first before crossing
there. The next room you will see many bugs, now you have to reach the next
door, so kill all of them for the Card Key. If you can reach the next door
without touching anyone of the bugs, the laser gate won't appear (random?),
means you no need to fight with the bugs.

After that come to a room with four Mako Point at each corner. Here you can get
the last G-file, it's located in the Northern corner, but not on the ground,
it's on the pipe above. You need to stand on the plate in the central first,
when the plate raise up, jump to the pipe, then search the North corner only
you can get it, coordinate at C-6. The DG soldiers are unlimited spawning here,
and all of them with protection, better prepare you magic enhancers here.
Nothing else other than G-file and Mako Points here, enter the next entrance
when you've done.

Some items could be found in the following passage. Press the blue switch to
open the door, cross the bridge to trigger a scene.

NOTE: Obtain three G-files for the extra ending, if you don't want to watch
      the extra ending, you can just leave it, and this is the last one.


BOSS FIGHT : Dragonfly PT

This airship again, now with some flying monster, and also some small robots
keep spawning around. Just kill the other enemies first then only focus to
the boss.

The machine gun attack doesn't deal much damage, but is better you can dodge
it, don't just stay still to let it shoot you. Run around the boxes could
protect you from its rocket although the rocket is homing at you, or you can
use melee attack to hit it away if you're very good it melee move. The small
robots aren't spawn that fast, no need to focus on them too much, but must
kill them when they're already came out.

In the middle of the battle, the boss will goes far, it will shoot you a rocket
then hide behind the building, then comes to shoot you another rocket, then
hide behind the building again. Pay attention to where it comes out, shoot it
as much as possible before it goes to hide again, then only evade the rocket,
because the rocket is very slow, if you can get the time right, you should
have enough times to evade the rocket.

After beaten it, go press the blue switch to open the following door, enter
there and go on passage. You have to face a group of DG soldiers in the last
corner here, also they all have protection, defeat them with magic of melee
attack. A Shop Machine before the next entrance.


BOSS FIGHT : ÉlÉçÅEÉâÉtÉåÉA (Nero Rough form)

The boss protecting by the barrier, you can destroy it by shooting it a few
time, but the purple barriered stones will cast another barrier to him, better
shoot down all purple stones first, then only shoot the boss. The stones will
attack you also, just run aways when the stone is unbarrier, when you dodge
it's attack, also the best time to shoot it.

If you're already shot down all purple stones, now becareful the meteors, it's
very small meteor, not hard to dodge them actually, just keep running and
shoot the boss until the cut scene.


BOSS FIGHT : Gorgonero

Plug you gun with long or medium barrel, don't recommend to use machine gun.
Don't turn your camera first, Nero will appears on one of the few stones
opposite you. You can see the black hole before he appears, aim to the
direction and wait him, once he comes out, he will shoot you. He will
disappears again after you hurt him, wait his following appearance to hurt
him again, and repeat. You can kill him by just a few shots only.

After finish off Nero, you can get 5,000 gils near the Shop Machine. Cross the
long passage to the entrance in East, trigger a long scene.


BOSS FIGHT : Weiss the Immaculate

You can't kill him now, save you ammo and items. After defeated by him, cut
scene.


BOSS FIGHT : Weiss Empowered

Now you can kill him. Don't stay close to him, always keep in long distance
so that you can see what's he going to do.

Stay behind the cylinder when he's shooting, counterattack when he's stop.
When you see he is spining his sword, meant he's preparing to use the wave
attack or sword attack, the wave will comes double, but is easy to evade, his
sword attack is dash to you can cut with his sword, keep running in a curve
route, turn the camera to look at him, once he stop the attack, shoot him one
or twice.

If he jumps after spun the sword, prepare to jump over his nova. Sometimes he
might jumps to you, if so, you just need to run further from him, other
he could hurt you in a row.

After you deal an amount of damage to him, he will jumps to the central and
charge the magic ball to shoot you. Now you can't hurt him until he jumps back,
you need to dodge the his magic balls. Because of the magic balls also homing
at you, so better you stay behind the cylinder, they probably couldn't hurt
you even they would explode.

Just remember to keep a distance with him, always counterattack when he's
stopped any of his move, he isn't a hard boss.

CHAPTER 11 END

After a few long scenes, finally you came to the last chapter. Now Vincent is
in his Chaos form and with a special gun named ÉfÉXÉyÉiÉãÉeÉB (Death Penalty),
Vincent ultimate weapon in FF-VII. Although this gun cannot be merged with any
accessories, but 500 point in all states is very strong enough already, just
use this gun for the whole chapter. Only two types of enemies in this chapter,
one is like a flower, it will shoot a ray after the petals are open. Another
enemy is machine cannon, its HP is more then the flower enemy, both of them
were always flying.

You need to reach to the South-East part for this area, just go the only way
here. Some new enemies will keep coming out, with your Death Penalty, you can
kill them very easy. An item at right side when you reached the first juntion.
Go until you jump in to the huge tube, get out from there through the hole
at right side in front, then go up follow the broken road, watch a scene.

Start in other section, just go forward and go up the stair at right side.
After that go to the Eastern area, and need to fight some enemies. Cross over
the bridga, you can found an Omega report behind the rusty crate at the round
pole. Now go up the stair and kill all enemies whoever appears here, then
will trigger another cut scene.

just shoot them when anyone came to you front. When you reach certain distance
will trigger a cut scene. Now no more flying, just kill all enemies here, the
enemies appear in the section are only the flower stone.

After the scene, now turn to your right side and following the road until
you reach to top. Enemies will spawn around, recommend zoom in the aiming mode
while going up, ignore them if not necessory to kill. Another cut scene when

You're going to the final battle, if you still have money, just maximize your
items from the shop after the chapter result, the final battle is quite tough.


BOSS FIGHT : Crystal Feelers

Wait until anyone of the crystal unshell, use melee attack to destroy it, since
your gun couldn't hurt them. The flower stones are unlimited spawning here.
This battle will end after you destroy all daimond.


BOSS FIGHT : ÉIÉÅÉKÉRÉNÅ[Éì

attack you, keep running and shoot is better. The boss can be destroyed within
a minute, even before the flower stone can hurt you.


BOSS FIGHT : Omega Weiss

The toughest boss in the game, for safety, you must prepare some recovery
items before. For non-Japanese version, you can use Limit Breaker to restore
your HP.

You can see Weiss is stinking on the Omega's core, if you successfully shot on
Weiss's body, he will get more damage. Always stay further so that you can
see your target clearer.

At the beginning he will shoot the missiles, destroy them if you can, but dodge
them is the better choise. The missile is homing at you, press square while
running to evade, and they will always come in group.

Sometime the missiles didn't hit the wall or ground, they will stop in that
place, now shoot them to avoid the future troubles. When you see Omega raises
up the arms, run away from the direction it's facing, it's a nova once when
the arms hit on the ground, if you couldn't run further enough, just jump over
the nova.

When you see many small pieces appeared, means Weiss is going to jumps down and
attack you, you can destroy the pieces things before he comes, bacause he
will use those pieces things to attack you later. Now focus on him, prepare to
evade his attacks, use L3 + square button technique and running. Shoot him
when you're gone father from him, remember always evade his attack first.
Repeat until he back to the Omega's body.

If you see Omega is going further, the meteor in coming down. Now turn the
camera view looking at him, run when the meteor was charged, jump or roll
away if necessory, the meteor hit a very large area and also deal large damage
if it hits you accuratly. You can't deal any damage when the meteor is
charging, so just prepare to dodge it. Omega will comes back with the golden
body now, try run aways from its chases until the golden body gone.

Mostly this boss will perform the missile or arms attack in the whole battle,
Weiss would jumps down one or twice, the meteor attack also not more then
three times normally, unless you really took very long time to beat it.
Just stop attack the boss when it's coming to attack you, especially the
missiles. Take some times, the victory is yours.

hit all missiles away. You don't need to look at the airship, turn your camera
to look abit down, so that you can see the distance of the missiles. Attack
when the missiles were around 5 or 6 feets away from Vincent, if you perform

===============================================================================
-------------------------------------------------- This mission's objective is
|  Mission Objective     : Collect the EX Medals | to collect all the EX medals
|------------------------------------------------| hidden throughout the area.
|  Conditions for Defeat : Suffer a KO /         | Use  stealth  tactics  to

|  Time Limit            : 5 Minutes             | aware that the clock will be

First, you must memorize all EX Medals locations, never the less you must retry
a few times on this stage. Anyway, the medals were at the coordinate C-3, B-5,
E-5 at the upstairs, I-4 go up through the boxes behind, E-3, M-7, M-8, K-8,
J-5 in the mid air, N-9, C-13, C-11, G-13, I-12, J-12.

When you reach to the Mako Point building, where you got the medals at M-7 and
M-8, go out the building and take the J-5 medal, then go behind the building
and take the one at N-9. Make sure you don't jump down for the J-12 medal for
now. Re-enter the building with Mako Point, follow the path at the back, go
pass the plank on window and climb the ladder at the back for another medal
on top of the tower. Back down and go through the plank, eventually you will
found a crate on the wall, now jump down to the right for the medal at I-12.
Climb up the ladder and follow the wall to the end, take the medal in the end,
jump down and pick up the remaining medals. The medal at J-12 should be the
last one.

|----------------------------------------------| The land mines below can be
|  Time Limit            : None                | deadly.
------------------------------------------------

Recommend prepare your Ultima Weapon or Griffon with 99 capacity for this
mission, so you don't need to reload when more targets come together. First,
run forward the wall and destroy the mines which were blocking your way, find
the slope at coordinate J-8. At this point, you can leave the wall, but make
sure you don't go too far or the time start counting, stay at this point and
take care of the mines come from left and right. As you have five seconds to
return to the wall, you can use this slope for dodging the mines, just in case
if the mines came closer and you haven't destroy it, run down the slope and
shoot it with your Short or Normal Barrel weapons. When the sector's clear or
the mines has gone further, faster get close to the wall before the time. If
you leave the wall again, the time will start counting from 5 seconds again,
so you can run down the slope to dodge the mines if necessary, then close to
the wall for stopping the time counting. Sometimes when you clear the sector,
equip rifle with Long Barrel, use it to check whether got some other mines
coming from further, destroy it if you spot any of it.

--------------------------------------------------

Start with very little of ammo, and lot of enemies can attack from further,
mean you should use your rifle bullets well. Slowly go forward, always look
around the mountains and some further area, you can spot most of the enemies
before they notice you. Try do the instant kill by shooting on their head, to
save the ammo. First you need to obtain 8 medals on the current area, they're
at the coordinate I-12 on the hill, K-12 under the bridge, L-11 on the hill,
I-9, I-9 in the left valley, I-7, on the bridge, H-7 on the fallen bridge, and
the last one at K-2 inside the building. Becareful when you enter the building
at K-2, there are two cannon soldiers waiting you at both corners.

Once you've done, unlock the laser gate at H-6, then head back to the beginning
point and climb the ladder, take Elixor on the hill. From H-6, go up and defeat
some more enemies, same as how you done before, don't try to close combat with
the shooter but swordmen. When the sector is clear, enter the building at G-3,
there's a machine gun soldier is waiting you at the right corner, defeat him
before obtain the medal. While going on for other medals, try shoot down the
shoot from further, and swordmen will always come to bother, so remember check
around you area from time to time. The medals were at H-8 on the bridge, D-6,
E-8, D-10, C-12, D-11, I-10 on the hill. Beware of the soldier spawn behind
you when you take the medal at I-10. After all, move on to the room at North,
you can see a Dual Horn inside there along with three medals. When you jump
inside, the Dual Horn will dash to you, since it's not good at turning skill,
so faster evade it by moving to the side and take the medals.

Memory Capsule:

Rosso has lesser HP, and since her moves is more on close combat, suggest to
defeat Rosso for first. Try surround on the pillar in the middle to avoid the
shots from Azul. You should pay attentions on Azul, dodge when his kick when
he's coming. Recommend use Cerberus for this battle, if you have Ultima Weapon,

There's lot of branch routes, but they're all lead to one direction. Thing to
remember, there are lot of enemies hiding at the appointed area, so be sure to
turn camera view and check around when you reach to any junctions. Most of them
will shoot when you arrive to certain area, so sometimes you can kill them
before they notice you. Check the random items drop from enemies, sometimes

First of all, plug your gun with Long Barrel, and shoot the soldiers that you
can see before head outside. A white Memory Capsule at F-8 unlock the next
mission named 'Chamber of Ghost', don't bother of finding it, just aim to the
tower at the central, you can see an explosive barrel and a crate on top of the
tower, shoot the crate and the barrel will automatically fall down to destroy
the Memory Capsule for you. On the way you should becareful of the invisible
mines, normally they were around the crates or items, they will only be visible
when you're close to it, destroy it when the mines exist. Move from the right
area all the way, there is a Phoenix Down, in the white case, take it and use
it.

Later on, you need a Card Key to unlock the laser gates. From the laser gates,
turn to left and shoot down the enemies on the building. Destroy the mine at
the entrance of the building before entering. Defeat Sahagins and the soldier
inside, out to the other side, climb the ladder to face some swordmen, you can
try lure them to jump down, before climbing up there. Some more enemies spawn
on the opposite building while you're going through the balcony. Defeat three
Cactuars in front the Card Key. Beware! There's another mine in front the Card
Key.

Once you've done crossing the laser gates, head to the right and defeat two
robotic enemies, then obtaint another Card Key for your goal point. Move to
the left, as you can see some enemies spawn in front of next the laser gates,
defeat them before you go to unlock the laser gates, because there's lot of
hidden mines around the laser gates, you have to destroy a part of the mines
there only you can reach to the laser gates. Once you've done, unlock the
laser gates and enter the goal point.

Memory Capsule:
1. At F-8, shoot the crate above of it, so the barrel can drops down and
   destroy it.

certain amount of these soldiers to get the Card Key for next level. Plug your

moving while you're destroying the enemies, since their cannons were not that
fast, you can evade them easily.

Find out the healing moogles at G-9, H-6, G-13, J-11, just in case you need
them. Around the structure in the middle, you can find some boxes, there's a
good place for this fight. Just around the boxes there so that you don't need
to worry for her gun attack. Her speed is definitely fast, always pay attention
on ther moves. While dodging her attacks by surrounding the boxes, you should
attack her when she'e stop moving. After her two-cuts attack, I've noticed she
needs more times to recover, so after her two cuts, don't waste the best chance
to attack. Remember only scratch her once and then faster run away to dodge her
counterattack.

Memory Capsule:
1. At G-8, use melee attack to destroy it.

|-----------------------------------------------|
| Time Limit            : 2 Minutes 40 seconds  |
-------------------------------------------------

The allotted time isn't that much, it's like you play the speed run for other
games, if you were stuck for any parts, you would probably fail this mission.
The items on the ground is actually the hint which leads to the goal, just keep
going according to the items. Inside the cave, prepare your weapon with short
barrel to destroy the blocking barrel. As for the red laser gates in the narrow
path, you can jump over them, for the triple laser gates, you should jump abit
further and press 'Square' to dash when you're sticking on the gates. Jump over
the gap. Reach to the main hall, some cannon soldiers attack you. Now you don't
need to go down with the stairs on left, direction jump down on the right, head
into the passage to right. Next room, jump over the blocking objects follow the
path formed by the laser gate. In the end, jump over the shorter laser gates.
You do have to dodge some cannons from the soldiers, shoot it away if possible.
When you see the goal point on your left, you can't go directly, just reach it
through the right area.

As the script mentions, strongly recommended to stay out of enemy's sight. Try
move behind the enemies, avoid the fight if possible. As you can see Cait Sith
is locked in the room at the beginning, if you save him, he will give you some
items randomly.

Memory Capsule:

   then talk to him and he will bring you up to the wall.

-----------------------------------------------------

You can also find three healing moogle around, but you might don't need to use
them, because this battle is pretty easy, what you want Azul to is perform a
big kick. To lure him kick you, you see his machine gun is quite long right,
if you stay further, he can shoot with his machine gun, but if you get into
his gun range, which means he can't attack you with his machine gun, so now he
will only try to kick you away. Of cause you must dodge his kick before attack,
just run to his side or back to evade the kick, scratch him once, then run to
evade his following kick, scratch him another once. Do remember keep the close
distance with him you will be knocked away by his machine gun bullets.

Memory Capsule:
1. At G/H-5, use melee attack to destroy it.

Keep running! Get some Limit Breakers from Cait Sith and use it when you're
low in HP. Try stand behind the window at each corner, lure the enemies come
from a side, flee from them through the outside side. When you're in the Galian
beast status, you can try know down the enemies which are blocking, but since
the enemies is unlimited, so you're don't need to defeat them. Make sure always
get the Limit Breaker from Cait Sith, keep using it to survive this 5 minutes.

Memory Capsule:
1. Inside the elevator, use melee attack to destroy it.

Go right, you should go through the path with some robots dashing there. Just
destroy the robots for easy life. When you reach the passage, prepare your
Cerberus or Ultima Weapon, pick up the X-potion there and face back to where
you came, shoot down three black orbs to unseal this area. Continue the passage
and you will face some more black orbs, like the robots before, they would
disappear at the appointed area and re-spawn from their starting point. The
only problem is the where you found the first explosive barrel, there's two
orbs will come together. Shoot the barrel to destroy the orb when it shown,
faster cross it before the next orb comes from the right. After this, you can
pass the rest easily. Remember the orbs will only go through their route, if
can stay out from their route, you won't get hit by the orbs, and each part
has a little space for you to dodge these orbs. Out from the passage, double
jump over the bikers and reach to the goal point.

--------------------------------------------------- blocking your path!

Since many people request the tactics to beat this mission, so I've decided to
go in-depth on this mission, hope this helps.

Recommend plug Gravity Floater on Hydra, prepare Ultima Weapon or Powered
Cerberus as well. The enemies is unlimited, so don't bother with clearing all
enemies from further area, and you should KEEP RUNNING to reduce chance of
getting shots. Always defeat the nearest enemies, depends on the situation,
some you can just run past them. Below is the strategy based on my run, it may
not the best way to finish this mission, but currently it's the good way I had.
Another thing is the metal slope which leads up to the tower, I just call it
bridge, hope you can understand.

Again, you don't need to worry about the soldiers from far, keep on going all
the ways and only defeat the soldier that's near. Once you've done preparing
your weapons, run out and jump into the triangle laser gate at D-8, jump abit
from the right can be easier. Obtain first medal and use the Card Key unlock
the laser gate. Move to right, shoot down the soldiers on the hill and pick up
the medal on the hill at D-10. Run in the passage encounter more enemies. Get
out the passage from other way, pay attention on the hill at right, there's a
soldier with machine gun, sometimes this soldier would spawn lately. Run up the
bridge to the tower, shoot down some more soldiers on the top. Turn back and
down to the slope in the middle, obtain medal on the barrel at I-7. Now back
to the top, jump down to the bridge, there might got a soldier on this bridge
now, just defeat him. Run up the bridge to the end, you can see another medal
on your left at G-9. After this, jump to the next bridge where the Mako Point
and the Limit Breaker by, from here look down and jump near the soldier below,
make sure you land on the ledge area, then defeat the soldier and take another
medal at G-9. Now face back to where you begin, jump to the bottom where you
headed into the passage before, the soldiers on the hill can be ignored, just
get into the passage and shoot down the soldiers blocking you in the passage.
Go to the same way like before until you get to the Mako Point bridge.

Once you reached Mako Point bridge again, jump up the bridge and down to other
side, there's another medal which at F-9. No way you can go after getting this
medal, jump down to the area where you headed into the passage before. Do the
same thing return to the Mako Point bridge again. Once you've done, follow the
Mako Point bridge to down. In the middle of the bridge, you can see some item
in the mid-air, at this point, jump down according the item direction (left),
to make sure you land on the right area, press 'X' to jump another time while
you're in the air. Now head to the pavilion at D-3, obtain the medal after
defeating the soldiers. Enter the passage on the right, follow it out to the
other side, prepare to defeat more soldiers when out from the passage. Follow
the only way here until you get to the slope, move up to the room at M-3 which
hidden another medal. Beware, the rock in front of this room hidden a soldier
as well, be sure you aim at it while going to the room. Afterwards, run down
the slope and you will see a medal on the ledge at J-7. Take the medal and 
move on the right, then run up the bridge. Around the middle of the bridge,
turn you camera to view bottom, jump down to right and make sure you land into
the triangle red laser gates to obtain the last medal.

First of all, turn back and pick up the Mine Detector, then defeat the first
two cactuars behind this item. Like 'Badlands' mission before, there's lot of
hidden mine around, when you heard like timing bomb voices, that's mean the
mine is around, and it will exist when you're very close to it. A Phoenix Down
at the East area, make your way to get it for some helps. Sometimes if you're
lucky, you could get Phoenix Down from the Cactuar.

As you can see lot of explosive barrels around, and lot of shielded enemies
during the mission, so you can shoot the barrel to explode them. But enemies
spawn more faster when you killed up to 50 targets, to try keep some barrels
for the second half of the battle, especially the barrels in the middle area.

|                          Exceed Time Limit  | a single lap, with the enemies
|---------------------------------------------| gaining in strength after each
|  Time Limit            : 5 Minutes/Lap      | run.
-----------------------------------------------

You don't need to defeat most of the enemies, for easier to run pass the
enemies, equip Blow/Blast Machine Gun, but don't use it if you want to defeat
the enemies. Search every side area for more items, especially the first lap,
you would get more useful items like Limit Breaker, Elixir and more. When you
come to the fourth lap, you will encounter the Turks in the South area, they
join with the Gargoyles is quite hard to be handle, so you must familiar with
the South area in the first three laps, knock the Turks down with Blast Machine
Gun when necessary, run pass them if you have chances, but sometimes you might
been forced to kill all of them.

Do rememeber with you're in the fourth laps, save Cait Sith at A-6. Once you've
done the fourth lap and before moving on to the last lap, you can obtain some
items from Cait Sith, just wait him to drop each item. Make sure you got enough
of healing items before starting your last lap. Thing to remember is the Limit
Breaker, since you can't use it if you fell, so at the flying mines sections,
don't prepare Limit Breaker as you main healing items, because you might get
combo hits if you done any mistake, and the Limit Breaker cannot be used
immediately to heal, so just prepare the potions all the times.
